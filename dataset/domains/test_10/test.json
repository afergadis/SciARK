            "The present study explores the impacts of renewable and non-renewable energy use and economic growth on carbon emissions in the developing Asian economies.",
            "The study adopts a robust version of two-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) on a panel of twenty-five upper-middle and lower-middle income economies for the period 1990 to 2015.",
            "The results show that the use of renewable energy helps in the control of carbon emissions, while the consumption of non-renewable energy contributes to the increase of carbon emissions in the developing Asian economies.",
            "Moreover, the results confirm inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita economic growth and carbon emissions in this region.",
            "Empirical results further depict that in developing countries, depletion of natural resources and growing population pressures are both contributing factors to carbon emissions.",
            "The findings spotlight that a transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources is indispensable if Asian developing countries are to control carbon emissions and foster carbon-free economic growth.",
            "Finally, the study suggests that regional cooperation (to expedite the transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources, and to facilitate the expansion of green bond markets to developing countries) may prove helpful for mitigating carbon emissions and for increasing investment in clean energy projects."

            "Framing Social Inclusion as a Benchmark for Cycling-Inclusive Transport Policy in Kisumu, Kenya",
            "Cycling in many cities of the Global South faces unending exclusion from street spaces despite the on-going transport policy reforms.",
            "This exclusion worsens the marginalisation of the poor majority who use this mode.",
            "In this paper, we formulate social inclusion as a policy tool for reconciling transport policy to the cycling needs of Kisumu, Kenya.",
            "We draw from social quality theory and Lefebvre\u2019s right to the city concept to assemble the ideals of social inclusion.",
            "These ideals form the benchmark for a qualitative content analysis of the policy pronouncements contained in the Kenya Vision 2030 and the Integrated National Transport Policy to ascertain the opportunities presented by these policies for cycling inclusion.",
            "Findings from interviews held with transport professionals in government and private practice support this content analysis.",
            "Results show that while the Kenya Vision 2030 focuses on economic growth, the Government has prioritised the implementation of its projects, thus diminishing the fragile opportunity for cycling inclusion presented by the transport policy.",
            "To consolidate this opportunity, we propose different policy recommendations to improve the terms for cyclists to claim and produce street spaces."

            " Is ethnic social diversity relevant to cross-national variation in economic development, or is the inclusion or exclusion of said groups in political decision-making the more salient factor?",
            "We argue that deleterious policy effects resulting in diminished economic growth are caused by exclusion of mobilized ethnic groups from the policy process and not just ethnic social diversity per se.",
            "Conversely, a positive impact of ethnicity as more groups are included in the policy process with increasing access to cabinet is due, first, to the fact that a population finding its preferences represented in the policy process likely supports implementation of resultant policy.",
            "Second, the policy quality likely improves with greater variety in input.",
            "Third, a greater number of included ethnic groups in cabinet increases the number of ethnic partisan veto players in the policy process \u2014 thereby generating increased policy stability in the long term.",
            "We test this idea first on long-run growth in democracy and, second, on annual indicators of growth.",
            "We find that increasing ethnic social fragmentation still negatively impacts on the economy.",
            "However, cabinet diversity offsets some of these negative effects as it improves growth of GDP per capita. "
