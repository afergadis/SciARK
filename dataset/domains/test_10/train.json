            "MHL and its measures have traditionally focused on knowledge and beliefs about mental -ill-health rather than on mental health.",
            "No measures of MHL addressing knowledge of good or positive mental health have been identified.",
            "Aim: This study aimed to develop and validate an instrument measuring adolescents' knowledge of how to obtain and maintain good mental health and to evaluate the psychometric properties of the instrument.",
            "More specifically, the factor structure, internal and construct validity, and test-retest reliability were assessed.",
            "Methods: The participants were Norwegian upper secondary school students aged 15-21 years.",
            "The development and validation of the instrument entailed three phases: 1) item generation based on the basic psychological needs theory (BPNT), focus group interviews, and a narrative literature review, 2) a pilot study (n = 479), and 3) test-retest (n = 149), known-groups validity (n = 44), and scale construction, item reduction through principal component analysis (PCA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for factor structure and psychometric properties assessment (n = 1888).",
            "Results: Thirty-two items were initially generated, and 15 were selected for the pilot study.",
            "PCA identified cross-loadings, and a one-factor solution was examined.",
            "After removing five problematic items, CFA yielded a satisfactory fit for a 10-item one-factor model, referred to as the mental health-promoting knowledge (MHPK-10) measure.",

            "AIM",
            "The aim of this report is to describe and analyze the results of four investigations on sexual functioning in different groups of cut women.",

            "RESULTS",
            "The group of 137 women, affected by different types of FGM/C, reported orgasm in almost 86%, always 69.23%; 58 mutilated young women reported orgasm in 91.43%, always 8.57%; after defibulation 14 out of 15 infibulated women reported orgasm; the group of 57 infibulated women investigated with the FSFI questionnaire showed significant differences between group of study and an equivalent group of control in desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction with mean scores higher in the group of mutilated women.",
            "No significant differences were observed between the two groups in lubrication and pain.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "Embryology, anatomy, and physiology of female erectile organs are neglected in specialist textbooks.",
            "In infibulated women, some erectile structures fundamental for orgasm have not been excised.",

            "Notwithstanding the improvement in gender equality in political power and resources in European democracies, this study shows that, on average, declared interest in politics is 16 per cent lower for women than for men in Europe.",
            "This gap remains even after controlling for differences in men's and women's educational attainment, material and cognitive resources.",
            "Drawing on the newly developed European Institute for Gender Equality's (EIGE) Gender Equality Index (GEI) and on the European Social Survey (ESS) fifth wave, we show that promoting gender equality contributes towards narrowing the magnitude of the differences in political interest between men and women.",
            "However, this effect appears to be conditioned by the age of citizens.",
            "More specifically, findings show that in Europe gender-friendly policies contribute to bridging the gender gap in political engagement only during adulthood, suggesting that childhood socialisation is more strongly affected by traditional family values than by policies promoting gender equality.",
            "In contrast, feminising social citizenship does make a difference by reducing the situational disadvantages traditionally faced by women within the family and in society for middle-aged people and older."

            "INTRODUCTION",
            "Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), also known as female circumcision, is an ancient traditional procedure that involves partial or total removal of the female external genitalia for nonmedical reasons.",
            "Although it is well described in African and some Arabic countries, data from Iran are scarce.",
            "AIM",
            "To describe the epidemiology, regional characteristics, knowledge, and attitude toward FGM/C in Southern Iran.",
            "METHODS",
            "This cross-sectional study was conducted during a 36-month period from 2010 to 2013 in Hormozgan, a southern province of Iran near the Persian Gulf.",
            "We included 780 women in six major rural areas of the province who referred to healthcare centers for vaccination, midwifery, or family planning services.",
            "All participants underwent complete pelvic examination to determine the type of FGM.",
            "The questionnaire consisted of several sections such as demographic and baseline characteristics, and two self-report sections addressing the knowledge and attitude toward FGM/C and its complications.",
            "Baseline sociodemographic characteristics including age, educational level, marital status, religion, and nationality were the independent variables.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Among the participants, 535 (68.5%) had undergone FGM/C.",
            "FGM/C was associated with higher age (P\u2009=\u20090.002), Afghan nationality (P\u2009=\u20090.003), Sunni Islam as religion (P\u2009=\u20090.019), illiteracy (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and family history of FGM/C in mother (P\u2009<\u20090.001), sister (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and grandmother (P\u2009<\u20090.001).",
            "Ancient traditions in the area (57.1%) were mentioned as the most important factor leading to FMG/C.",
            "Urinary tract infection was the most common reported complication (60.4%).",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "FGM/C is a common practice in rural areas of Southern Iran.",
            "It is associated with increased age, illiteracy, Sunni Islam religion, Afghan nationality, and positive family history.",
            "Lack of knowledge toward FGM/C is the main cause of its high prevalence and continuation in the area."

            "The most significant targets of these goals are the fulfillment of basic human needs and desires, since essential human necessities like food, cloth, shelter and health care are still not accessible to a majority of the people despite the great pace in the world's economy.",
            "Increased waste products and continuously depleting natural resources have diverted human attention towards efficient green and clear production technologies.",
            "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim at providing these fundamental necessities to everyone through the intelligent use of sustainable science.",
            "In this perspective, microorganisms, which are vital to the maintenance of life on earth, can play a major role.",
            "Although most people focus primarily on the disease-causing capabilities of microorganisms, there are numerous positive functions that microbes perform in the environment and hence, a need to explore the microbial world astutely as it can contribute tremendously to sustainable development.",
            "In this review, the integration of microbial technology for the achievement of SDGs is being put forth.",
            "The scope of the use of microorganisms, points of their control, methods for their better utilization and the role of education in achieving these targets are being discussed.",
            "If the society is educated enough about the ways that microbes can affect our lives, and if microbes are used intelligently, then some significant problems being faced by the world today including food, health, well-being and green energy can be adequately taken care of."

            "Background:                    Urban outdoor air pollution, especially particulate matter, remains a major environmental health problem in Skopje, the capital of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.",
            "Despite the documented high levels of pollution in the city, the published evidence on its health impacts is as yet scarce.",
            "Methods:                    we obtained, cleaned, and validated Particulate Matter (PM) concentration data from five air quality monitoring stations in the Skopje metropolitan area, applied relevant concentration-response functions, and evaluated health impacts against two theoretical policy scenarios.",
            "We then calculated the burden of disease attributable to PM and calculated the societal cost due to attributable mortality.",
            "Results:                    In 2012, long-term exposure to PM2.5 (49.2 \u03bcg/m\u00b3) caused an estimated 1199 premature deaths (CI95% 821-1519).",
            "The social cost of the predicted premature mortality in 2012 due to air pollution was estimated at between 570 and 1470 million euros.",
            "Moreover, PM2.5 was also estimated to be responsible for 547 hospital admissions (CI95% 104-977) from cardiovascular diseases, and 937 admissions (CI95% 937-1869) for respiratory disease that year.",
            "Reducing PM2.5 levels to the EU limit (25 \u03bcg/m\u00b3) could have averted an estimated 45% of PM-attributable mortality, while achieving the WHO Air Quality Guidelines (10 \u03bcg/m\u00b3) could have averted an estimated 77% of PM-attributable mortality.",
            "Both scenarios would also attain significant reductions in attributable respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions.",
            "Conclusions:                    Besides its health impacts in terms of increased premature mortality and hospitalizations, air pollution entails significant economic costs to the population of Skopje.",
            "Reductions in PM2.5 concentrations could provide substantial health and economic gains to the city."

            "Method: A systematic search of English entries in PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar was conducted in September 2017.",
            "Methodological quality of the studies was independently assessed by two authors using the Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal checklists.",
            "Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity in methods and outcomes; results were synthesised and displayed narratively.",

            "Despite widespread global efforts to promote clean cookstoves to achieve improvements in air and forest quality, and to reduce global climate change, surprisingly little is known about the degree to which these actually reduce biomass fuel consumption in real-world settings.",
            "Using data from in-house weighing of fuel conducted in rural India, we examine the impact of cleaner cookstoves \u2fff most of which are LPG stoves \u2fff on three key outcomes related to solid fuel use.",
            "Our results suggest that using a clean cookstove is associated with daily reductions of about 4.5 kg of biomass fuel, 160 fewer minutes cooking on traditional stoves, and 105 fewer minutes collecting biomass fuels.",
            "These findings of substantial savings are robust to the use of estimators with varying levels of control for selection, and to alternative data obtained from household self-reports.",
            "Our results support the idea that efforts to promote clean stoves among poor rural households can reduce solid fuel use and cooking time, and that rebound effects toward greater amounts of cooking on multiple stoves are not sufficient to eliminate these gains.",
            "We also find, however, that households who have greater wealth, fewer members, are in less marginalized groups, and practice other health-averting behaviors, are more likely to use these cleaner stoves, which suggests that socio-economic status plays an important role in determining who benefits from such technologies.",
            "Future efforts to capture social benefits must therefore consider how to promote the use of alternative technologies by poor households, given that these households are least likely to own clean stoves."

            "Abstract: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) assessed a range of scenarios of future greenhouse-gas emissions without policies to specifically reduce emissions, and concluded that these would lead to an increase in global mean temperatures of between 1.6\u00b0C and 6.9\u00b0C by the end of the twenty-first century, relative to pre-industrial.",
            "While much political attention is focused on the potential for global warming of 2\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial, the AR4 projections clearly suggest that much greater levels of warming are possible by the end of the twenty-first century in the absence of mitigation.",
            "The centre of the range of AR4-projected global warming was approximately 4\u00b0C.",
            "The higher end of the projected warming was associated with the higher emissions scenarios and models, which included stronger carbon-cycle feedbacks.",
            "The highest emissions scenario considered in the AR4 (scenario A1FI) was not examined with complex general circulation models (GCMs) in the AR4, and similarly the uncertainties in climate\u2013carbon-cycle feedbacks were not included in the main set of GCMs.",
            "Consequently, the projections of warming for A1FI and/or with different strengths of carbon-cycle feedbacks are often not included in a wider discussion of the AR4 conclusions.",
            "While it is still too early to say whether any particular scenario is being tracked by current emissions, A1FI is considered to be as plausible as other non-mitigation scenarios and cannot be ruled out.",

            "This paper presents simulations of climate change with an ensemble of GCMs driven by the A1FI scenario, and also assesses the implications of carbon-cycle feedbacks for the climate-change projections.",
            "Using these GCM projections along with simple climate-model projections, including uncertainties in carbon-cycle feedbacks, and also comparing against other model projections from the IPCC, our best estimate is that the A1FI emissions scenario would lead to a warming of 4\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial during the 2070s.",
            "If carbon-cycle feedbacks are stronger, which appears less likely but still credible, then 4\u00b0C warming could be reached by the early 2060s in projections that are consistent with the IPCC\u2019s \u2018likely range\u2019."

            "The transition to cleaner energy sources has seen a much higher penetration of renewable sources of electricity on the grid than ever before.",
            "Among these renewable generation sources are wind and solar power which provide intermittent and often unpredictable energy generation throughout the day depending on weather conditions.",

            "Due to the effect that such technological transitions will have on domestic end-users, it is important that these new technologies are designed with end-users in mind.",
            "It is therefore necessary that software tools are available to model and simulate these changes at the domestic level to guide the design of new systems.",
            "This thesis provides a summary of some of the existing building energy analysis tools that are available and shows that there is currently a shortcoming in the capabilities of existing tools when modelling future domestic smart grid technologies.",

            "Abstract: In just the past 5 years, the field of Earth observation has progressed beyond the offerings of conventional space-agency-based platforms to include a plethora of sensing opportunities afforded by CubeSats, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and smartphone technologies that are being embraced by both for-profit companies and individual researchers.",
            "Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically of the order of 1 billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines of the order of 2 decades (for new missions).",
            "More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturize sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing ultra-high (3\u20135\u202fm) resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis.",
            "Start-up companies that did not exist a decade ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency, and at costs that are a mere fraction of traditional satellite missions.",

            "Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-metre resolutions, pushing back on spatio-temporal constraints and delivering new process insights.",
            "At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizen scientists to catalogue photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and sense other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices.",
            "Global internet access is being pursued via high-altitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the internet of things as an entirely new measurement domain.",
            "Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms.",
            "This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret.",

            "Future water availability is affected directly by climate change mainly through changes in precipitation and indirectly by the biological effects of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) through changes in vegetation water use.",
            "Previous studies of climate change impact on hydrology have focused on the direct impact and little has been reported in the literature on catchment-scale the indirect impact.",
            "In this study, we calibrated an ecohydrological model (WAVES) and used this model to estimate the direct and indirect effects and the interactive effect between climate change and eCO2 on water availability in four different catchments in Australia with contrasting climate regime and vegetation cover.",
            "These catchments were: a water-limited forest catchment and an energy-limited forest catchment, a water-limited grass catchment and an energy-limited grass catchment.",
            "The future meteorological forcing was projected from 12 GCMs representing a period centred on 2050s and future CO2 concentration was set as 550ppm.",
            "Modelling experiments show that impacts of eCO2 and projected climate change on vegetation growth, evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff were in the same magnitude but opposite directions in all four catchments, except for the effects on runoff in the energy-limited grass catchment.",
            "Predicted responses of runoff to eCO2 indicate that eCO2 increased runoff in the energy-limited forest catchment by \u223c2% but decreased runoff in other three catchments from 1% to 18%.",
            "This study indicates that rising CO2 increases ecosystem water use efficiency but it does not necessarily result in increased runoff because elevated CO2 also stimulates vegetation growth and increases ET.",
            "Elevated CO2 was proved to have greater impacts on runoff than climate change in the forest catchments.",
            "Modelling experiments also suggest that interactive effects between climate and CO2 are important, especially for predicting leaf area index (LAI) and ET in grassland catchments or runoff in water-limited catchments, where interactive effects were 1\u20136%.",
            "It implies that the assumption that linear combination of individual effects in most of previous studies is not appropriate.",
            "This study highlights the importance of considering elevated CO2 in assessing climate change impacts on catchment-scale water balance and failure to account for direct eCO2 effect or its interactive effects can lead to large bias in the predictions of future water budgets, especially for the water-limited catchments in Australia."

            "Essential to the development of a low carbon economy will be the advancement of building product and process to reduce the capital and whole lifecycle cost of low, zero and net-positive energy buildings to allow these structures to be realized at a greater rate.",
            "On the whole, the built environment is responsible for one of the largest fractions of global energy consumption and thus anthropomorphic climate change, a result of the greenhouse gas emissions from power generation.",
            "When one also considers the energy required to design, fabricate, transport and construct the materials necessary to bring new building stock online, keeping pace with the rapid trend towards urbanization, the importance of the built environment in the energy sustainability equation is clearly evident.",
            "Yet, while technologically feasible, the realization of carbon neutral buildings is encumbered by the perception of increased annualized costs for operation and a greater upfront investment.",
            "This paper will review the design case of the Masdar International Headquarters, the flagship building of the net-zero carbon emission Masdar city currently being developed within the Abu Dhabi Emirates.",
            "Specifically, how an integrated approach enabled by computer simulation early within the design process allowed for improvements in economy and efficiency, setting a model for future high performance buildings.",
            "The five-story, 89,040-square-meter office building will incorporate eleven sculpted glass environmental towers to promote natural ventilation and introduce daylight to the interior of the building.",
            "These towers will also serve as the structural support for one of the world\u2019s largest building integrated photovoltaic arrays, sized to supply 103% of the building\u2019s total annual energy requirements while protecting the building and roof garden from intense heat and solar gains.",
            "Moreover, by integration into a separate structural trellis system, clean energy can potentially be generated to offset construction requirements while dually shading workers below during the heat of the day.",
            "This, along with other key sustainability design strategies such as a solar powered central district cooling system, thermoactive foundation piling, underfloor air distribution, desiccant dehumidification, a nanotechnology enabled building envelope and smart grid enabled facilities management infrastructure will allow the Masdar Headquarters to reach carbon neutrality within a decade, allowing for the remaining century of its operation to serve as a platform for clean energy generation."

            "This rate is two times higher than most other European Union countries.",
            "Materials and methods:                    The research is based on a secondary analysis of data contained in multiple Polish governmental reports, including those of the Prevention and Analysis Office of Road Traffic Headquarters of Police, National Road Safety Program-GAMBIT 2005, National Road Safety Program 2013 to 2020, and Strategy for Efficient State in 2020, plus previous publications describing road safety in Poland.",

            "The people most affected are among the world's poorest, and past experience has shown that securing adoption and sustained use of effective, low-emission stove technologies and fuels in such populations is not easy.",
            "Among the questions raised by these challenges are (i) to what levels does HAP exposure need to be reduced in order to ensure that substantial health benefits are achieved, and (ii) what intervention technologies and fuels can achieve the required levels of HAP in practice?",

            "Almost 70% of that came from the transportation sector alone.",
            "Thus, there lies a direct correlation between the growing consumption of oil by the transportation sector and our rising need for imported oil.",

            "These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations.",
            "Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass.",

            "For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling).",
            "When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich sources becomes slightly negative (-0.06 W m-2 with 90% uncertainty bounds of -1.45 to +1.29 W m-2).",
            "The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon.",

            "The initiative has set itself the lofty aim of providing energy service comparable to clean sources such as LPG but using the same solid biomass fuels commonly used today.",
            "Such a clean energy option for the estimated 160 million Indian households now cooking with inefficient and polluting biomass and coal cookstoves could yield enormous gains in health and welfare for the weakest and most vulnerable sections of society.",
            "At the same time, cleaner household cooking energy through substitution by advanced-combustion biomass stoves (or other options such as clean fuels) can nearly eliminate the several important products of incomplete combustion that come from today's practices and are important outdoor and greenhouse pollutants.",
            "Using national surveys, published literature and assessments, and measurements of cookstove performance solely from India, we find that about 570,000 premature deaths in poor women and children and over 4% of India's estimated greenhouse emissions could be avoided if such an initiative were in place today.",
            "These avoided emissions currently would be worth more than US$1 billion on the international carbon market.",
            "In addition, about one-third of India's black carbon emissions can be reduced along with a range of other health- and climate-active pollutants that affect regional air quality and climate.",

            "Proxies indicate that prior to the end-Permian extinction event tropical sea surface temperatures ranged from ~22 to 25\u00b0C, and possible pCO2 values ranged from ~500 to ~4000ppm before the extinction event.",

            "We find that the temperature anomaly during the end-Permian extinction is consistent with ~1.5 doublings of atmospheric pCO2, and that the implied climate sensitivity is 5\u20136\u00b0C, within the upper range of values produced by climate models."

            "Understanding the importance of their behavioural thermoregulation by habitat use can provide novel information for predicting the fate of alpine Lepidoptera and other insects under ongoing climate change.",
            "We studied the link between microhabitat use and thermoregulation in adults of seven species of a butterfly genus Erebia co-occurring in the Austrian Alps.",
            "We captured individuals in the field and measured their body temperature in relation to microhabitat and air temperature.",
            "We asked whether closely related species regulate their body temperature differently, and if so, what is the effect of behaviour, species traits and individual traits on body to air and body to microhabitat temperature differences.",
            "Co-occurring species differed in mean body temperature.",
            "These differences were driven by active microhabitat selection by individuals and also by species\u2013specific habitat preferences.",
            "Species inhabiting grasslands and rocks utilised warmer microclimates to maintain higher body temperature than woodland species.",
            "Under low air temperatures, species of rocky habitats heated up more effectively than species of grasslands and woodlands which allowed them to stay active in colder weather.",
            "Species morphology and individual traits play rather minor roles in the thermoregulatory differences; although large species and young individuals maintained higher body temperature.",
            "We conclude that diverse microhabitat conditions at small spatial scales probably contribute to sympatric occurrence of closely related species with different thermal demands and that preserving heterogeneous conditions in alpine landscapes might mitigate detrimental consequences of predicted climate change."

            "Married women's negotiation for safer sexual intercourse in Kenya: Does experience of female genital mutilation matter?",
            "ABSTRACT",
            "OBJECTIVE",
            "Married women's ability to negotiate for safer sex is important for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya.",
            "Yet, its relationship to female genital mutilation is rarely explored, although female genital mutilation has been described as a social norm and marker of womanhood that can control women's sexuality.",
            "Drawing on the social normative influence theory, this study addressed this void in the literature.",
            "METHODS",
            "We analysed data from the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey using logistic regression.",
            "Our sample included 8,602 married women.",
            "Two indicators of safer sex, namely the ability to refuse sex and the ability to ask for condom use, were explored.",
            "RESULTS",
            "We found that women who had undergone genital mutilation were significantly less likely to report that they can refuse sex (OR=0.87; p<.05) and that they can ask for condom use during sexual intercourse (OR=0.62; p<.001) than their counterparts who had not undergone genital mutilation, while controlling for theoretically relevant variables.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "Our findings indicate that the experience of female genital mutilation may influence married women's ability to negotiate for safer sex through gendered socialization and expectations.",
            "Based on these findings, several policy implications are suggested.",
            "For instance, culturally sensitive programmes are needed that target both married women who have undergone genital mutilation and their husbands to understand the importance of safer sexual practices within marriage."

            "In this paper we take a closer look at these dynamic effects, in particular saving and capital accumulation.",

            "Approach:                    The study used retrospective time-series data of air quality and of naturally-occurring deaths recorded in Delhi to identify changes in the daily all-natural-cause mortality rate that could be attributed to changes in air quality.",

            "Physiological and social criteria suggest that most boys and girls aged 14 and younger are much too young for sexual, marital, and reproductive transitions, while many among the 15\u201317-year-olds are also too young (Dixon-Mueller 2008).",
            "Child marriage, defined here as marriage before the age of 18, is known to have negative impacts on health as well as educational attainment, labor force participation, intimate partner violence, and empowerment (for a review, see Parsons et al.",
            "2015, in this issue).",

            "The second objective of the article, which is the focus of the following section, is to caution against broad generalizations about child marriage and faith affiliation, in order to show that beyond stylized facts derived from household survey data, there is also substantial heterogeneity within the adherents of any particular faith as to how the practice of child marriage is considered.",

            "The model estimates the total canopy cover of all woody phanerophytes and the concept is based on the significant difference in phenophases of dryland trees, shrubs and bushes as compared to that of the herbaceous plants.",
            "Whereas annual herbaceous plants are only green during the rainy season and senescence occurs shortly after flowering towards the last rains, most woody plants remain photosynthetically active over large parts of the year.",
            "We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) - VEGETATION (VGT) Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) time series and test 10 metrics representing the annual FAPAR dynamics for their ability to reproduce in situ woody cover at 43 sites (163 observations between 1993 and 2013) in the Sahel.",

            "Multiple regression models using the integral of FAPAR from the onset of the dry season to the onset of the rainy season, the start date of the growing season and the rate of decrease of the FAPAR curve achieve a cross validated r2/RMSE (in % woody cover) of 0.73/3.0 (MODIS) and 0.70/3.2 (VGT).",
            "The extrapolation to Sahel scale shows agreement between VGT and MODIS at an almost nine times higher woody cover than in the global tree cover product MOD44B which only captures trees of a certain minimum size.",

            "In EU 28 Member States LE at birth reached 83.3 years (women) and 77.9 years (men) on average in 2015.1 The gender gap in life expectancy (GGLE) at birth has narrowed from 6.4 years (2002) to 5.4 years (2015) on EU average but the size of this gender gap still varies substantially in Europe.1 As biological differences appear to play a minor role in explaining the GGLE,2,3 differences in social relationships or health-risk behaviour gain attention.4,5",

            "As possible theoretical explanations for this trend, diminishment of gender inequality,3 role expansion theory (undertaking of different social roles such as paid work, child care and household activities),3 or convergence in unhealthy behaviours (reduction of risk behaviour in men, adoption of risk behaviour in women or both) are discussed.4 Social relationships and health-risk behaviour are shaped by social norms but studies on the influence of societal factors on LE are rare.6 Gender inequality, i.e.",
            "unequal distribution of wealth, power and benefits among women and men, is one of the most important societal factors.",

            "The GII measures loss of human development in three dimensions with five indicators: reproductive health (maternal mortality ratio, adolescent birth rate), political empowerment (share of parliamentary seats held by each sex, attainment at secondary and higher education levels) and economic status (labour market participation rate).",
            "It ranges from 0, where women and men score equally, to 1, where one gender scores as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions.10 We calculated the GGLE (2015) by subtracting the LE of men from that of women.",

            "The results show a positive, although weak correlation between GGLE and GII in the expected direction: the lower the gender inequality on a national level the smaller the GGLE.",

            "The correlation is even stronger than the association between GGLE and GII.",
            "Both results indicate that gender inequality is related to the health of women and men.",
            "The fact that in men a moderate correlation between LE and GII can also be observed, proves a positive association between gender equality and men\u2019s health.",
            "It could be cautiously interpreted that convergence of behaviours as well as expansion of roles as consequences of increasing gender equality might influence the LE of women and men.",
            "The limitation of the study is that the health dimension \u2018maternal mortality ratio\u2019 is part of the GII.",
            "The maternal mortality ratio itself affects the LE of women in the direction that higher maternal mortality ratios lead to lower life expectancies for women and thus to a reduction of the GGLE.",
            "However, the maternal mortality ratio is rather low in EU 28 Member States and differs between three deaths per 100 000 live births (Finland, Greece and Poland) and 31 death per 100 000 live births (Romania).",

            "Results: Both women and men said that participation in Athena SWAN had brought about important structural and cultural changes, including increased support for women's careers, greater appreciation of caring responsibilities, and efforts to challenge discrimination and bias.",
            "Many said that these positive changes would not have happened without linkage of Athena SWAN to government research funding, while others thought there were unintended consequences.",
            "Concerns about the programme design and implementation included a perception that Athena SWAN has limited ability to address longstanding and entrenched power and pay imbalances, persisting lack of work-life balance in academic medicine, questions about the sustainability of positive changes, belief that achieving the award could become an end in itself, resentment about perceived positive discrimination, and perceptions that further structural and cultural changes were needed in the university and wider society.",
            "Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that Athena SWAN has a positive impact in advancing gender equality, but there may be limits to how much it can improve gender equality without wider institutional and societal changes.",
            "To address the fundamental causes of gender inequality would require cultural change and welfare state policies incentivising men to increase their participation in unpaid work in the family, which is beyond the scope of higher education and research policy."

            "Forced sterilization of women as discrimination",
            "Abstract",
            "There has been a long history of subjecting marginalized women to forced and coerced sterilization.",
            "In recent years, the practice has been documented in countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.",
            "It has targeted women who are ethnic and racial minorities, women with disabilities, women living with HIV, and poor women.",
            "A handful of courts have issued decisions on the recent forced sterilization of marginalized women finding that such actions violate the women's rights.",
            "However, they have all failed to address the women's claims of discrimination.",
            "The failure to acknowledge that forced sterilization is at its core a violation of the prohibition of discrimination undermines efforts to eradicate the practice.",
            "It further fails to recognize that coerced and forced sterilization fundamentally seeks to deny women deemed as \"unworthy\" the ability to procreate.",
            "Four key principles outlined in the human rights in patient care framework highlight the importance of a finding that the prohibition of discrimination was violated in cases of forced sterilization: the need to highlight the vulnerability of marginalized populations to discrimination in health care settings; the importance of the rights of medical providers; the role of the state in addressing systemic human rights violations in health care settings; and the application of human rights to patient care.",
            "Based on these principles, it is clear that finding a violation of the prohibition of discrimination in forced sterilization cases is critical in addressing the systemic nature of the practice, acknowledging the marginalization of specific groups and effectively ending forced sterilization through addressing the underlying purpose of the practice.",
            "If litigators, non-governmental organizations and judicial officers are mindful of these principles when dealing with cases of forced sterilization, it is likely that they will be better able to eradicate forced sterilization."

            "Abstract",
            "Background: Although Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is internationally considered a harmful practice, it is increasingly being medicalized allegedly to reduce its negative health effects, and is thus suggested as a harm reduction strategy in response to these perceived health risks.",
            "In many countries where FGM/C is traditionally practiced, the prevalence rates of medicalization are increasing, and in countries of migration, such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America or Sweden, court cases or the repeated issuing of statements in favor of presumed minimal forms of FGM/C to replace more invasive forms, has raised the debate between the medical harm reduction arguments and the human rights approach.",
            "Main body: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the arguments associated with the medicalization of FGM/C, a trend that could undermine the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 5.3.",
            "The paper uses four country case studies, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya and UK, to discuss the reasons for engaging in medicalized forms of FGM/C, or not, and explores the ongoing public discourse in those countries concerning harm reduction versus human rights, and the contradiction between medical ethics, national criminal justice systems and international conventions.",
            "The discussion is structured around four key hotly contested ethical dilemmas.",
            "Firstly, that the WHO definition of medicalized FGM/C is too narrow allowing medicalized FGM to be justified by many healthcare professionals as a form of harm reduction which contradicts the medical oath of do no harm.",
            "Secondly, that medicalized FGM/C is a human rights abuse with lifelong consequences, no matter who performs it.",
            "Thirdly, that health care professionals who perform medicalized FGM/C are sustaining cultural norms that they themselves support and are also gaining financially.",
            "Fourthly, the contradiction between protecting traditional cultural rights in legal constitutions versus human rights legislation, which criminalizes FGM/C.",
            "Conclusion: More research needs to be done in order to understand the complexities that are facilitating the medicalization of FGM/C as well as how policy strategies can be strengthened to have a greater de-medicalization impact.",
            "Tackling medicalization of FGM/C will accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal of ending FGM by 2030"

            "Constructions of masculinity and femininity that position men as dominant and highly sexually active and women as subordinate and acquiescent have been found to contribute towards gender inequality.",
            "This inequality is in turn related to negative health consequences, specifically violence against women, children, and other men, as well as sexual risk.",

            "First, it characterises the scale and significance of the contemporary \u2018infrastructural moment\u2019, observing how, in many national contexts, energy policy-making remains centralised and divorced from public participation.",

            "Abstract: In just the past 5 years, the field of Earth observation has progressed beyond the offerings of conventional space-agency-based platforms to include a plethora of sensing opportunities afforded by CubeSats, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and smartphone technologies that are being embraced by both for-profit companies and individual researchers.",
            "Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically of the order of 1 billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines of the order of 2 decades (for new missions).",
            "More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturize sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing ultra-high (3\u20135\u202fm) resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis.",
            "Start-up companies that did not exist a decade ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency, and at costs that are a mere fraction of traditional satellite missions.",
            "With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as real-time high-definition video for tracking air pollution, storm-cell development, flood propagation, precipitation monitoring, or even for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques.",
            "Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-metre resolutions, pushing back on spatio-temporal constraints and delivering new process insights.",
            "At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizen scientists to catalogue photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and sense other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices.",
            "Global internet access is being pursued via high-altitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the internet of things as an entirely new measurement domain.",
            "Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms.",
            "This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret.",
            "The extent to which today's hydrologic models can usefully ingest such massive data volumes is unclear.",
            "Nor is it clear whether this deluge of data will be usefully exploited, either because the measurements are superfluous, inconsistent, not accurate enough, or simply because we lack the capacity to process and analyse them.",
            "What is apparent is that the tools and techniques afforded by this array of novel and game-changing sensing platforms present our community with a unique opportunity to develop new insights that advance fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences.",
            "To accomplish this will require more than just an application of the technology: in some cases, it will demand a radical rethink on how we utilize and exploit these new observing systems."

            "In practice, few prioritise the issue.",
            "Institutions with considerable global power therefore largely overlook fundamental drivers of adverse health outcomes: gender inequality and harmful gender norms.",

            "Methods Drawing on scholarship from the fields of organisational behavior and management, sociology, international relations and the policy process, we undertook a thematic analysis of peer-reviewed scholarship and organisational documents.",
            "We also conducted 20 semi-structured interviews over Skype with individuals working at the cross-section of gender and health.",
            "Results In seeking to reform the policies and practices of global health organisations, gender proponents confront patriarchal organisational cultures, hostile political environments and an issue that is difficult to address as it requires upsetting existing power structures.",
            "Proponents also face three linked challenges internal to their own networks.",
            "First, there is little cohesion among champions themselves, as they are fragmented into multiple networks.",
            "Second, proponents differ on the nature of the problem and solutions, including whether reducing gender inequality or addressing harmful gender norms is the primary goal, the role of men in gender initiatives, which health issues to prioritise, and even the value of proponent cohesion.",
            "Third, there are disagreements among proponents on how to convey the problem.",
            "Some advance an instrumental case, while others believe that it should be portrayed as a human rights issue and using any other argument undermines that fundamental justification.",
            "Conclusions Prospects for building more gender-responsive global health organisations will depend in part on the ability of proponents to address these disagreements and develop strategies for negotiating difficult organisational cultures and political environments."

            "Structured Abstract",
            "INTRODUCTION",
            "Understanding determinants of gender differences in economic and social domains has been of interest, both in academic and public debates.",
            "Previous research has shown that gender differences in fundamental economic preferences are important in explaining gender differences in economic outcomes, such as for occupational choice, financial investment, or educational decisions, among many others.",
            "However, gaps remain in understanding the sources of gender differences in preferences and their variation.",
            "RATIONALE",
            "We contrasted and tested two hypotheses that make opposite predictions concerning the cross-country association of gender differences in preferences with economic development and gender equality.",
            "On one hand, the attenuation of gender-specific social roles that arises in more developed and gender-egalitarian countries may alleviate differences in preferences between women and men.",
            "As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be negatively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (social role hypothesis).",
            "On the other hand, greater availability of material and social resources removes the gender-neutral goal of subsistence, which creates the scope for gender-specific ambitions and desires.",
            "In addition, more gender-equal access to those resources may allow women and men to express preferences independently from each other.",
            "As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be positively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (resource hypothesis).",
            "We tested these competing predictions using data on experimentally validated measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples.",
            "So that the data would be geographically representative, the dataset was chosen so as to include all continents and a broad range of cultures and economic development levels.",
            "In total, the data represent about 90% of both the world population and global income.",
            "RESULTS",
            "The data revealed substantial cross-country variation in gender differences in preferences.",
            "Gender differences were found to be strongly positively associated with economic development as well as gender equality.",
            "These relationships held for each preference separately as well as for a summary index of differences in all preferences jointly.",
            "Quantitatively, this summary index exhibited correlations of 0.67 (P < 0.0001) with log GDP per capita and 0.56 (P < 0.0001) with a Gender Equality Index (a joint measure of four indices of gender equality), respectively.",
            "To isolate the separate impacts of economic development and gender equality, we conducted a conditional analysis, finding a quantitatively large and statistically significant association between gender differences and log GDP per capita conditional on the Gender Equality Index, and vice versa.",
            "These findings remained robust in several validation tests, such as accounting for potential culture-specific survey response behavior, aggregation bias, and nonlinear relationships.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "The reported evidence indicates that higher levels of economic development and gender equality favor the manifestation of gender differences in preferences across countries.",

            "Background",
            "Access to, and sustained adoption of, clean household fuels at scale remains an aspirational goal to achieve sufficient reductions in household air pollution (HAP) in order to impact on the substantial global health burden caused by reliance on solid fuels.",
            "Aim and objectives",
            "To systematically appraise the current evidence base to identify: (i) which factors enable or limit adoption and sustained use of clean fuels (namely liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, solar cooking and alcohol fuels) in low- and middle-income countries; (ii) lessons learnt concerning equitable scaling-up of programmes of cleaner cooking fuels in relation to poverty, urban\u2013rural settings and gender.",
            "Methods",
            "A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted using established review methodology and extensive searches of published and grey literature sources.",

            "A broad range of inter-related enabling and limiting factors were identified for all four types of intervention, operating across seven pre-specified domains (i.e.",
            "fuel and technology characteristics, household and setting characteristics, knowledge and perceptions, financial, tax and subsidy aspects, market development, regulation, legislation and standards, and programme and policy mechanisms) and multiple levels (i.e.",
            "household, community, national).",

            "Background",
            "In 2007, the Indonesian Government instigated a national program to convert domestic kerosene users to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking.",
            "This was primarily motivated by the rising cost of kerosene subsidies.",
            "Objective",
            "To review the national conversion program and LPG scale up by evaluating its impacts, including assessing sustained changes in cooking behaviour and consequent reductions in exposure to household air pollution (HAP).",
            "Methods and data sources",
            "Searches of peer-review and grey literature in both English and Bahasa Indonesian were conducted and supplemented by interviews with key informants, data from the National Statistics Agency and results from household surveys.",
            "The data were extracted and analyzed using an Implementation Science approach.",
            "Results",
            "The main kerosene to LPG conversion phase took place in highly populated kerosene dependent areas between 2007 and 2012 reaching over 50 million households, approximately two thirds of all households in Indonesia.",
            "Since then the drive to expand LPG use has continued at a slower pace, especially in more remote provinces where solid fuel is more widely used.",
            "Over 57 million LPG start up kits were distributed as of 2015.",
            "Beginning in 2018, the open subsidy for LPG is expected to be replaced by one targeted at lower income households.",
            "While the main conversion phase has been highlighted as an example of effective and impressively fast fuel switching at scale, the impact on domestic biomass use remains limited.",

            "Methods: A cross-sectional, multicenter study (Israel, USA, and Germany), was conducted.",
            "Our conceptual model suggests that positive oral health attributes, which integrate with positive unawareness or positive awareness on the one hand and with positive perception on the other hand, may result via appropriate oral health behavior on positive oral health.",
            "The 17-item self-administered index was built on a theoretical concept by four experts from Israel and Germany.",
            "Reliability, factor, and correlation analyses were performed.",
            "For external correlations and to measure construct validity of the instrument, we utilized the oral health impact profile-14, self-perceived oral impairment, life satisfaction, self-perceived well-being, sociodemographic and behavioral data, and oral health status indices.",
            "Results: Four hundred and seventy participants took part in our three-center study.",
            "The combined data set reliability analyses detected two items which were not contributing to the index reliability.",
            "Thus, we tested a 15-item construct, and a Cronbach's \u03b1 value of 0.933 was revealed.",
            "Primary factor analysis of the whole sample indicated three subconstructs which could explain 60 % of variance.",
            "Correlation analyses demonstrated that the POHW and OHIP-14 were strongly and negatively associated.",
            "The POHW correlated strongly and positively with general well-being, moderately with life satisfaction, and weakly with the perceived importance of regular dental checkups.",
            "It correlated moderately and negatively with perceived oral impairment, and marginally and negatively with dental caries experience (DMFT) and periodontal health status (CPI) scores.",
            "When DMFT and CPI clinical measurements were categorized, a higher score of POHW was revealed for better oral health.",
            "Discussion: Our study introduced a new instrument with good reliability and sound correlations with external measures.",
            "This instrument is the first to allow measurability of positive instead of impaired oral health.",
            "We utilized subjective-psychological and functional-social measures.",
            "The current results indicate that by further exploring our conceptual model, POHW may be of importance for identifying patients with good and poor oral health, and building an effective and inexpensive strategy for prevention, by being able to evaluate the effect of interventions in a standardized way."

            "Abstratc:Phenotypic plasticity, if adaptive, may allow species to counter the detrimental effects of extreme conditions, but the infrequent occurrence of extreme environments and/or their restriction to low-quality habitats within a species range means that they exert little direct selection on reaction norms.",
            "Plasticity could, therefore, be maladaptive under extreme environments, unless genetic correlations are strong between extreme and non-extreme environmental states, and the optimum phenotype changes smoothly with the environment.",
            "Empirical evidence suggests that populations and species from more variable environments show higher levels of plasticity that might preadapt them to extremes, but genetic variance for plastic responses can also be low, and genetic variation may not be expressed for some classes of traits under extreme conditions.",
            "Much of the empirical literature on plastic responses to extremes has not yet been linked to ecologically relevant conditions, such as asymmetrical fluctuations in the case of temperature extremes.",

            "Three key drivers of wetland response to sea-level rise are considered: 1) rate of sea-level rise relative to tidal range; 2) lateral accommodation space; and 3) sediment supply.",

            "It is applied across 12,148 coastal segments (mean length 85km) to the year 2100.",
            "The model provides better-informed macro-scale projections of likely patterns of future coastal wetland losses across a range of sea-level rise scenarios and varying assumptions about the construction of coastal dikes to prevent sea flooding (as dikes limit lateral accommodation space and cause coastal squeeze).",

            "Here we show that in the aftermath of the record-breaking marine heatwave on the Great Barrier Reef in 20162, corals began to die immediately on reefs where the accumulated heat exposure exceeded a critical threshold of degree heating weeks, which was 3\u20134\u2009\u00b0C-weeks.",

            "Abstract",
            "Integration of renewable energy source (RES) generation to displace diesel generation can present clear economic, environmental and social benefit.",
            "While low level RES integration is relatively easy to achieve, both the cost and complexity escalate as systems target increasing RES penetration.",
            "A key barrier to greater RES penetrations remains the inefficiency of diesel generation to operate at low or partial loading.",
            "To achieve low or partial loading, conventional fixed speed diesel technologies must rely on prescribed purge routines, which serve to increase emissions intensity and fuel consumption.",
            "Fixed speed constraint remains the primary barrier to increased engine flexibility and improved partial load efficiency.",
            "This paper investigates redesign of the diesel generator to achieve variable speed operation.",

            "Abstract",
            "Policy Points Current efforts to reduce infant mortality and improve infant health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can benefit from awareness of the history of successful early 20th-century initiatives to reduce infant mortality in high-income countries, which occurred before widespread use of vaccination and medical technologies.",
            "Improvements in sanitation, civil registration, milk purification, and institutional structures to monitor and reduce infant mortality played a crucial role in the decline in infant mortality seen in the United States in the early 1900s.",
            "The commitment to sanitation and civil registration has not been fulfilled in many LMICs.",
            "Structural investments in sanitation and water purification as well as in civil registration systems should be central, not peripheral, to the goal of infant mortality reduction in LMICs.",
            "Context: Between 1915 and 1950, the infant mortality rate (IMR) in the United States declined from 100 to fewer than 30 deaths per 1,000 live births, prior to the widespread use of medical technologies and vaccination.",
            "In 2015 the IMR in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) was 53.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is comparable to the United States in 1935 when IMR was 55.7 deaths per 1,000 live births.",
            "We contrast the role of public health institutions and interventions for IMR reduction in past versus present efforts to reduce infant mortality in LMICs to critically examine the current evidence base for reducing infant mortality and to propose ways in which lessons from history can inform efforts to address the current burden of infant mortality.",
            "Methods: We searched the peer-reviewed and gray literature on the causes and explanations behind the decline in infant mortality in the United States between 1850 and 1950 and in LMICs after 2000.",
            "We included historical analyses, empirical research, policy documents, and global strategies.",
            "For each key source, we assessed the factors considered by their authors to be salient in reducing infant mortality.",
            "Findings: Public health programs that played a central role in the decline in infant mortality in the United States in the early 1900s emphasized large structural interventions like filtering and chlorinating water supplies, building sanitation systems, developing the birth and death registration area, pasteurizing milk, and also educating mothers on infant care and hygiene.",
            "The creation of new institutions and policies for infant health additionally provided technical expertise, mobilized resources, and engaged women's groups and public health professionals.",
            "In contrast, contemporary literature and global policy documents on reducing infant mortality in LMICs have primarily focused on interventions at the individual, household, and health facility level, and on the widespread adoption of cheap, ostensibly accessible, and simple technologies, often at the cost of leaving the structural conditions that determine child survival largely untouched.",
            "Conclusions: Current discourses on infant mortality are not informed by lessons from history.",
            "Although structural interventions were central to the decline in infant mortality in the United States, current interventions in LMICs that receive the most global endorsement do not address these structural determinants of infant mortality.",
            "Using a historical lens to examine the continued problem of infant mortality in LMICs suggests that structural interventions, especially regarding sanitation and civil registration, should again become core to a public health approach to addressing infant mortality.",

            "The minimum-maintenance LMP without irrigation and fertilization can reduce annual N2O emissions and net GWPs by approximately 53% and 70%, respectively, with the price of gradual depletion of soil organic carbon, when compared to the intensive-maintenance LMP.",
            "A lawn age-dependent best management practice is recommended: a high dose fertilizer input at the initial stage of lawn establishment to enhance SOC sequestration, followed by decreasing fertilization rate when the lawn ages to minimize N2O emissions.",
            "A minimum-maintained LMP with clipping recycling, and minimum irrigation and mowing, is recommended to mitigate global warming effects from urban turfgrass systems.",
            "Among all practices, clipping recycle may be a relatively malleable behavior and, therefore, a good target for interventions seeking to reduce the environmental impacts of lawn management through public education.",

            "A Relative Index of Inequality (RII) estimated from the Poisson regression was employed to measure the level of social inequality.",
            "Family affluence was significantly positively associated with higher adolescent life satisfaction in nearly all countries (RII = 1.344; 95% confidence interval: 1.330\u207b1.359).",
            "The average RII values for boys and girls were almost equal (1.318) and did not differ significantly across 11-, 13- and 15-year-old groups (1.373, 1.324 and 1.342, respectively).",
            "However, the gender and age differences in this association were controversial across countries.",
            "An analysis of data by countries revealed that among students from Israel, Italy and Ireland (in seven countries altogether), social inequality in life satisfaction (LS) was significantly greater for girls, while among students from Norway, the Republic of Moldova and the Czech Republic (in 20 countries altogether), social inequality in LS was significantly greater among boys; in 14 countries, the RII value did not significantly differ between boys and girls.",
            "Comparing social inequality in LS between 11- and 15-year-olds, in nine countries (e.g., Belgium-Flemish, Czech Republic, Netherlands) the RII was significantly greater among 15-year-olds, in 16 countries (e.g., Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Spain) the RII was significantly greater among 11-year-olds, and in 16 countries there were no significant differences in RII values.",
            "In conclusion, social inequality in adolescent LS differs between boys and girls and between age groups, providing substantial variation in these differences across countries."

            "Abstract",
            "This article aims to do two things.",
            "First, it argues that moralization of health occurs not only at the practical level of individual healthcare choices and health states, but also at the conceptual level of health itself.",
            "This is most evident in cases where the concept of health is presumed to possess the property of \"overridingness\" when compared to competing values and norms, that is, when it is treated as taking precedence over other values and norms it may come into conflict with.",
            "Second, the article makes a case for being critically skeptical of specific deployments of the concept of health when it has been moralized in this way.",
            "In such cases, what typically results is that some other personal value/norm, or set of values/norms, held by the individual is treated as intrinsically at odds with the concept of health, which is presumed, uncritically, to be superior, often because it is taken to be free-standing and self-justifying.",
            "Yet, a growing body of evidence-based research suggests that the role played by dimensions of personal meaningfulness in the quality of individuals' overall health is quite underappreciated.",
            "It is useful to think of these dimensions of personal meaning and significance as representing the individual's values.",
            "Thus, taking these data more seriously ought to lead to a reevaluation of the moralization of health at the conceptual level.",
            "In the first place, it is not obvious that if the concept of health runs afoul of other values/norms held by an individual, the latter should automatically yield.",
            "In the second place, they suggest that other values/norms held by an individual are not necessarily intrinsically opposed to the concept of health, but in fact may go a good distance in support of it.",

            "The GCF should therefore reserve partial grants for emerging economies to enhance total co-financing.",

            "STUDY QUESTION",
            "How do the psychological health and experiences of surrogate mothers change from 1 year to 10 years following the birth of the surrogacy child?",
            "SUMMARY ANSWER",
            "The psychological well-being of surrogate mothers did not change 10 years following the birth, with all remaining positive about the surrogacy arrangement and the majority continuing to report good mental health.",
            "WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY",
            "Studies have found that surrogates may find the weeks following the birth difficult, but do not experience psychological problems 6 months or 1 year later.",
            "Research has also shown that surrogates can form close relationships with the intended parents during the pregnancy which may continue after the birth.",
            "STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION",
            "This study used a prospective longitudinal design, in which 20 surrogates were seen at two time points: 1 year following the birth of the surrogacy child and 10 years later.",
            "PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS",
            "The 20 surrogates (representing 59% of the original sample) participated in a semi-structured interview and completed self-report questionnaires.",
            "Eleven surrogates were gestational carriers and nine surrogates had used their own oocyte (genetic surrogacy).",
            "Four were previously known to the intended parents and 16 were previously not known.",
            "MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE",
            "Ten years following the birth of the surrogacy child, surrogate mothers scored within the normal range for self-esteem and did not show signs of depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory.",
            "Marital quality remained positive over time.",
            "All surrogates reported that their expectations of their relationship with the intended parents had been either met or exceeded and most reported positive feelings towards the child.",
            "In terms of expectations for the future, most surrogates reported that they would like to maintain contact or would be available to the child if the child wished to contact them.",
            "None expressed regrets about their involvement in surrogacy.",
            "LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION",
            "The sample size of this study was small and the women may not be representative of all surrogates.",
            "Therefore the extent to which these findings can be generalized is not known.",
            "WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS",
            "Contrary to concerns about the potentially negative long-term effect of surrogacy, the findings suggest that surrogacy can be a positive experience for some women at least.",
            "These findings are important for policy and practice of surrogacy around the world."

            "Theorized using Two-Eyed Seeing, an Indigenous approach to balancing both Indigenous and non-Indigenous understandings of the world, the findings reported here reveal 3 themes, each of which is crosscut by historical and contemporary dimensions: 1) (w)holistic conceptualizations of health are essential to good oral health, 2) achieving optimal oral health is prohibitive for Inuit communities, and 3) community-engaged oral health service delivery is needed.",

            "Abstract",
            "Women's equality and empowerment are international development priorities, but are difficult to achieve.",
            "Much gender and development literature blames entrenched \u201ctraditional\u201d gender roles and norms, using them to explain slow progress towards gender and development goals, such as girls\u2019 and women's education, women's participation in public decision-making, and women's land and property ownership.",

            "However, limited research examines the full range of ways in which people, who live in highly gender-unequal societies, actually use traditional gender narratives to negotiate issues of women's empowerment and gender equality.",
            "Drawing on qualitative data collected from three rural South Sudanese communities\u2014comprising interviews and focus groups with 94 research participants, and over five hours of community radio content\u2014this study demonstrates that gender narratives considered to be traditional by the South Sudanese, during a post-conflict transition period, do not necessarily constitute barriers to the advancement of gender and development goals.",
            "Rather, the South Sudanese use traditional gender narratives, in this context, to both resist and support goals that the international development community prioritizes.",
            "By providing evidence that traditional gender narratives are mobilized and used by community members to support women's equality and empowerment, this paper challenges and extends development scholarship that positions traditional narratives as barriers, and encourages development practitioners to consider how they might critically harness, rather than reject, such narratives in the pursuit of gender and development goals."

            "They also estimated gender distribution in occupations and domestic roles for each time-point.",
