            "The paper also asks farmers whether they perceive any barriers to adaptation and attempts to determine the characteristics of those farmers who, despite claiming to have witnessed climate change, have not yet responded to it.",
            "The study is based on a large-scale survey of agriculturalists in 11 African countries.",
            "The survey reveals that significant numbers of farmers believe that temperatures have already increased and that precipitation has declined.",
            "Those with the greatest experience of farming are more likely to notice climate change.",
            "Further, neighboring farmers tell a consistent story.",
            "There are important differences in the propensity of farmers living in different locations to adapt and there may be institutional impediments to adaptation in some countries.",
            "Although large numbers of farmers perceive no barriers to adaptation, those that do perceive them tend to cite their poverty and inability to borrow.",
            "Few if any farmers mentioned lack of appropriate seed, security of tenure, or market accessibility as problems.",
            "Those farmers who perceive climate change but fail to respond may require particular incentives or assistance to do what is ultimately in their own best interests.",
            "Although experienced farmers are more likely to perceive climate change, it is educated farmers who are more likely to respond by making at least one adaptation."

            "Objectives",
            "To quantitatively assess the relationships of childhood experiences of marriage, pregnancy, and sexual violence with underage sex trafficking.",
            "Methods",
            "Cross-sectional survey data from a population-based sample of 603 female sex workers from Tijuana and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, were collected in 2013 and 2014, and we analyzed the data to evaluate relationships between pregnancy, marriage, and sexual violence when younger than 16 years, and child sex trafficking.",
            "Results",
            "Adjusted odds of child sex trafficking among those who experienced pregnancy, marriage, and childhood sexual violence when younger than 16 years in combined models were 2.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.8, 4.3), 1.7 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.99, 2.8), and 1.7 (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01, 3.0), respectively, relative to others (n\u2009=\u2009603).",
            "For 89.8%, 78.0%, and 97.0% of those who had an experience of pregnancy (n\u2009=\u200969), marriage (n\u2009=\u200950), or sexual violence (n\u2009=\u200933) when younger than 16 years, respectively, the experience occurred before or the same year as sex trafficking.",
            "Conclusions",
            "These results provide empirical evidence of modifiable risk factors for child sex trafficking that could be integrated into the prevention efforts and protocols of health clinics and governmental agencies in Mexico currently working to reduce underage pregnancy, marriage, and sexual violence."

            "While crude suicide rates were static over the time period, age-adjusted rates declined.",
            "The significant increase in suicide mortality in 1998 was primarily driven by large changes in the rate of hanging, with suicide deaths after 1998 having 36.7% higher odds of being due to hanging for men (95% CI: 16.3-60.8%), and 21.9% higher odds of being due to hanging for women (95% CI: 9.2-35.9%).",
            "Hanging has become an increasingly important method for committing suicide over the past 40 years, and although suicide rates have been declining continuously over this time, more effort is needed to prevent hanging and address the potential cultural drivers of suicide if the rate is to continue to decline in the future."

            "Abstract",
            "This paper explains some adverse effects due to a massive injection of renewables when electricity storage is not available, such as a fall of electricity prices on the spot market or a crowding-out effect for nuclear power stations due to the merit order logic.",
            "From the French experience, it presents a model that calculates the additional cost of electricity production when the share of nuclear generation is reduced to 50% instead of 72% today and when, in compensation, renewable energy (wind and solar) is stored either by batteries or by power-to-gas.",
            "The simulations minimize the cost of the energy mix by optimizing the electricity storage mix: batteries (daily storage) and Power-to-Gas/Gas-to-Power (seasonal storage).",
            "The paper also estimates the negative externalities of intermittent renewable energies that lie in between 44 and 107 \u20ac/MWh.",
            "It also examines the impact on the merit order when those negative externalities are accounted for.",
            "Finally, the simulation results lead us to provide some recommendations concerning R&D electricity storage policy and electricity mix fine tuning."

            "Forty-five percent were circumcised and 71% had type 1, while 24% had type 2 female genital cutting.",
            "No significant differences between cut and uncut women were observed in the frequency of reports of sexual intercourse in the preceding week or month, the frequency of reports of early arousal during intercourse and the proportions reporting experience of orgasm during intercourse.",

            "Uncut women were significantly more likely to report that the clitoris is the most sexually sensitive part of their body (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.26-0.47), while cut women were more likely to report that their breasts are their most sexually sensitive body parts (OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.51-2.42).",
