            "The authors examined a cohort of faculty from the 1995 National Faculty Survey to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty.",
            "Method: The authors followed 1,273 faculty at 24 medical schools in the continental United States for 17 years to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty.",

            "The authors used regression models to adjust for covariates: seniority, department, academic setting, and race/ethnicity.",
            "Results: After adjusting for significant covariates, women were less likely than men to achieve the rank of professor (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78) or to remain in academic careers (OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94).",
            "When number of refereed publications was added to the model, differences by gender in retention and attainment of senior rank were no longer significant.",
            "Male faculty were more likely to hold senior leadership positions after adjusting for publications (OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69).",
            "Conclusions: Gender disparities in rank, retention, and leadership remain across the career trajectories of the faculty cohort in this study.",
            "Women were less likely to attain senior-level positions than men, even after adjusting for publication-related productivity.",
            "Institutions must examine the climate for women to ensure their academic capital is fully utilized and equal opportunity exists for leadership."

            "While in Hemidactylus and Haemodracon this involved great differences in body size and low levels of climatic diversification (mostly involving sympatric distributions), an opposite pattern appeared in Pristurus in which most of the diversification involved shifts in climatic envelopes (mostly involving allopatric and parapatric distributions) but almost no size differentiation.",
            "Consistently with this, Pristurus was the only genus in which rates of size diversification in islands were substantially lower than in the continent.",

            "However, in South Asia, where the majority of girl child marriages occur, substantial improvements in girl education have not corresponded to equivalent reductions in child marriage.",

            "Results In Bangladesh and Pakistan, primary education was not protective against girl child marriage; in Nepal, it was protective against marriage at <14 years (AOR\u200a=\u200a0.42) but not for older adolescents.",

            "In India, primary and secondary education were respectively protective across all age at marriage categories (<14 years AOR\u200a=\u200a0.34, AOR\u200a=\u200a0.05; 14\u201315 years AOR\u200a=\u200a0.52, AOR\u200a=\u200a0.20; 16\u201317 years AOR\u200a=\u200a0.71, AOR\u200a=\u200a0.48).",

            "Female genital cutting in this group of women did not attenuate sexual feelings.",
            "However, female genital cutting may predispose women to adverse sexuality outcomes including early pregnancy and reproductive tract infections.",
            "Therefore, female genital cutting cannot be justified by arguments that suggest that it reduces sexual activity in women and prevents adverse outcomes of sexuality."

            "This paper investigates the gendered patterns and dynamics of labour exploitation and forced labour in the cocoa supply chain.",
            "The empirical basis of our analysis is an original primary dataset produced through the Global Business of Forced Labour project, which includes data gathered in Ghana in 2016\u20132017, comprising 60 in-depth interviews and a survey of 497 cocoa workers across 74 cocoa communities from Ghana\u2019s two largest cocoa-producing regions, the Western and Ashanti Regions.",
            "Drawing on this dataset, we show that prevailing business models within the Ghanaian cocoa industry rely on and reinforce labour exploitation and unequal gender power relations.",
            "Given that the links between forced labour and gender remain poorly understood, we analyse the factors that render women workers disproportionately vulnerable to severe labour exploitation, underscoring the role of unequal family relations, responsibility for reproductive labour, and social property relations in creating vulnerability to exploitation."

            "Consequently, the tonnage produced and dispersion degree are considered in the proposed index.",
            "This new index would lead to more developed policies that could reduce the consumption of scarce materials with higher replacement costs.",
