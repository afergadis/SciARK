            "The study analyzes the heterogeneous effects of energy efficiency (EE), renewable energy (RE), and other variables on carbon emissions within the context of the environment Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in 66 developing countries from 1990 to 2014.",

            "energy savings, emissions), economic (e.g.",
            "GDP, employment), and social (health, energy poverty) aspects.",
            "We explain the methodological approach, the underlying data sources and limitations.",
            "The indicator set has been applied to 29 countries (EU28 plus Norway) for the period 2000 to 2015, proving that it allows to conduct in-depth comparisons of developments and differences across Europe.",
            "The indicator set also supports the design of well-suited energy policies by allowing to take into account, on an informed basis, more of the multiple impacts of energy efficiency.",
            "For example, our analysis of the effect of energy savings for the period 2000 to 2015 in Germany shows GHG savings of about 158 MtCO2eq., about 30,000 avoided deaths due to less air pollution, a reduction of Germany's import dependency by 5.8 percentage points and a growth of GDP by around 0.3% per year for the period 2010 to 2015) as a consequence of improved energy efficiency.",
            "To conclude, the presented approach allows to comprehensively and regularly assess policies in terms of their MB-EEs."

            "Paired Wilcoxon and McNemar tests were used to compare data.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Of the 12 women included, 9 (75%) had type II mutilations.",
            "Results showed a global sexual dysfunction (median FSFI summary score=17) before surgery.",
            "Clitoral sensations were absent in 8 women (67%).",
            "Six months after surgery, all FSFI dimensions except lubrication had improved significantly (median FSFI summary score=29, P=0.009).",

            "SAMPLE",
            "Two hundred and thirty-three Sudanese and 92 Somali women who were delivered at the hospital between January 1996 and December 1999.",

            "ABSTRACT",
            "INTRODUCTION",
            "Clitoral reconstruction following female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is a new surgical technique reported to be a feasible and effective strategy to reduce clitoral pain, improve sexual pleasure, and restore a vulvar appearance similar to uncircumcised women.",
            "However, data on safety, care offered, and evaluation of sexual and pain outcomes are still limited.",
            "AIMS",
            "This study aims to present the care offered and clinical outcomes of two women who received multidisciplinary care, including psychosexual treatment, with clitoral reconstruction.",
            "We report their long-term outcomes, and the histology of the removed periclitoral fibrosis.",
            "METHODS",
            "We report the cases of two women with FGM/C types II and III who requested clitoral reconstruction for different reasons.",
            "One woman hoped to improve her chronic vulvar pain, as well as improve her sexual response.",
            "The other woman requested surgery due to a desire to reverse a procedure that was performed without her consent, and a wish to have a genital appearance similar to non infibulated women.",
            "They both underwent psychosexual evaluation and therapy and surgery.",
            "The histology of the periclitoral fibrosis removed during surgery was analyzed.",
            "RESULTS",
            "At 1-year postoperatively, the first woman reported complete disappearance of vulvar pain and improved sexual pleasure, including orgasm.",
            "Our second patient also described improved sexuality at 1-year follow-up (increased sexual desire, lubrication, vulvar pleasure, and sensitiveness), which she attributed to a better self body image and confidence.",
            "Both women reported feeling satisfied, happy, and more beautiful.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "We show a positive outcome in pain reduction and improved sexual function, self body image, and gender after psychosexual therapy and clitoral reconstruction.",
            "More evidence is needed about clitoral reconstruction to develop guidelines on best practices.",
            "Until research is conducted that rigorously evaluates clitoral reconstruction for its impact on pain and sexuality, we advise always offering a multidisciplinary care, including sexual therapy before and after the surgery."

            "Child marriage remains highly prevalent in Africa, especially in rural areas and among vulnerable socio-economic groups (UNFPA 2012; UNICEF 2014; Nguyen and Wodon 2015a).",
            "Physiological and social criteria suggest that most boys and girls aged 14 and younger are much too young for sexual, marital, and reproductive transitions, while many among the 15\u201317-year-olds are also too young (Dixon-Mueller 2008).",
            "Child marriage, defined here as marriage before the age of 18, is known to have negative impacts on health as well as educational attainment, labor force participation, intimate partner violence, and empowerment (for a review, see Parsons et al.",
            "2015, in this issue).",
            "It therefore makes sense, as many countries have done, including in Africa, to legally restrict marriage before the age of 18.",
            "Yet despite such restrictions, many girls still marry early, suggesting that more needs to be done to eliminate the practice.",
            "If faith plays a role in the continuation of the practice, there should be a role for faith leaders and faith-based organizations in the fight against child marriage, as argued by Walker (2015) and Karam (2015) in this issue.",
            "But does faith really play an important role in the persistence of the practice of child marriage?",
            "This is a complex question to answer, and different types of data can be brought to bear.",
            "In order to provide an introductory discussion of the issue, this article has two main objectives.",
            "The first objective, which is the focus of the next section, is to provide an account of trends in child marriage in Africa and a brief analysis of the statistical association between child marriage and faith affiliation.",
            "This helps to establish broad stylized facts or general observations on the basis of household survey data as to whether the likelihood of marrying early differs by faith affiliation.",
            "Results suggest that it does, with higher child marriage among Muslim, Animist/traditional belief populations, and those without a faith affiliation in comparisons to Catholics and Protestants.",
            "The second objective of the article, which is the focus of the following section, is to caution against broad generalizations about child marriage and faith affiliation, in order to show that beyond stylized facts derived from household survey data, there is also substantial heterogeneity within the adherents of any particular faith as to how the practice of child marriage is considered.",
            "The analysis focuses on Islamic communities.",
            "As pointed out by Lewis and Lockheed (2007), many Islamic communities throughout the world have managed to sharply reduce the prevalence of child marriage and have embraced girls\u2019 education and women's employment.",
            "The heterogeneity of attitudes towards child marriage is illustrated with a case study for rural Muslim communities in Burkina Faso, based on previous work by Gemignani and Wodon (2015a, 2015b).",

            "Gender roles and social expectations, as well as prevailing conceptions about Islamic Law and the fear of pregnancy before marriage, all play a role in the persistence of the practice.",
            "But at the same time there are also important differences in the drivers of child marriage between communities, suggesting that policy and program responses to child marriage should take into account local conditions\u2014including those pertaining to faith\u2014if they are to be successful."

            "Abstract",
            "Background",
            "In 2007, the Indonesian Government instigated a national program to convert domestic kerosene users to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking.",
            "This was primarily motivated by the rising cost of kerosene subsidies.",
            "Objective",
            "To review the national conversion program and LPG scale up by evaluating its impacts, including assessing sustained changes in cooking behaviour and consequent reductions in exposure to household air pollution (HAP).",
            "Methods and data sources",
            "Searches of peer-review and grey literature in both English and Bahasa Indonesian were conducted and supplemented by interviews with key informants, data from the National Statistics Agency and results from household surveys.",
            "The data were extracted and analyzed using an Implementation Science approach.",
            "Results",
            "The main kerosene to LPG conversion phase took place in highly populated kerosene dependent areas between 2007 and 2012 reaching over 50 million households, approximately two thirds of all households in Indonesia.",
            "Since then the drive to expand LPG use has continued at a slower pace, especially in more remote provinces where solid fuel is more widely used.",
            "Over 57 million LPG start up kits were distributed as of 2015.",
            "Beginning in 2018, the open subsidy for LPG is expected to be replaced by one targeted at lower income households.",
            "While the main conversion phase has been highlighted as an example of effective and impressively fast fuel switching at scale, the impact on domestic biomass use remains limited.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Addressing HAP and the health impacts associated with kerosene and biomass use was never an objective of the program.",
            "Consequently, there is limited evidence of impact in this area, and in hindsight, missed opportunities in terms of influencing cooking behaviour change among biomass users, who are more at risk."

            "Married women's ability to negotiate for safer sex is important for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya.",
            "Yet, its relationship to female genital mutilation is rarely explored, although female genital mutilation has been described as a social norm and marker of womanhood that can control women's sexuality.",

            "Our sample included 8,602 married women.",
            "Two indicators of safer sex, namely the ability to refuse sex and the ability to ask for condom use, were explored.",
            "RESULTS",
            "We found that women who had undergone genital mutilation were significantly less likely to report that they can refuse sex (OR=0.87; p<.05) and that they can ask for condom use during sexual intercourse (OR=0.62; p<.001) than their counterparts who had not undergone genital mutilation, while controlling for theoretically relevant variables.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "Our findings indicate that the experience of female genital mutilation may influence married women's ability to negotiate for safer sex through gendered socialization and expectations.",
            "Based on these findings, several policy implications are suggested.",
            "For instance, culturally sensitive programmes are needed that target both married women who have undergone genital mutilation and their husbands to understand the importance of safer sexual practices within marriage."

            "Thus, LE can indicate health inequalities in the population.",

            "In EU 28 Member States LE at birth reached 83.3 years (women) and 77.9 years (men) on average in 2015.1 The gender gap in life expectancy (GGLE) at birth has narrowed from 6.4 years (2002) to 5.4 years (2015) on EU average but the size of this gender gap still varies substantially in Europe.1 As biological differences appear to play a minor role in explaining the GGLE,2,3 differences in social relationships or health-risk behaviour gain attention.4,5",

            "In other EU countries a comparable trend can be observed.",
            "As possible theoretical explanations for this trend, diminishment of gender inequality,3 role expansion theory (undertaking of different social roles such as paid work, child care and household activities),3 or convergence in unhealthy behaviours (reduction of risk behaviour in men, adoption of risk behaviour in women or both) are discussed.4 Social relationships and health-risk behaviour are shaped by social norms but studies on the influence of societal factors on LE are rare.6 Gender inequality, i.e.",
            "unequal distribution of wealth, power and benefits among women and men, is one of the most important societal factors.",

            "The rationale is that gender differences in health related behaviours contribute to the gender gap in mortality and thus to LE, as behaviour is influenced by gender norms.",

            "The results show a positive, although weak correlation between GGLE and GII in the expected direction: the lower the gender inequality on a national level the smaller the GGLE.",

            "The correlation is even stronger than the association between GGLE and GII.",
            "Both results indicate that gender inequality is related to the health of women and men.",
            "The fact that in men a moderate correlation between LE and GII can also be observed, proves a positive association between gender equality and men\u2019s health.",
            "It could be cautiously interpreted that convergence of behaviours as well as expansion of roles as consequences of increasing gender equality might influence the LE of women and men.",
            "The limitation of the study is that the health dimension \u2018maternal mortality ratio\u2019 is part of the GII.",
            "The maternal mortality ratio itself affects the LE of women in the direction that higher maternal mortality ratios lead to lower life expectancies for women and thus to a reduction of the GGLE.",
            "However, the maternal mortality ratio is rather low in EU 28 Member States and differs between three deaths per 100 000 live births (Finland, Greece and Poland) and 31 death per 100 000 live births (Romania).",

            "Future water availability is affected directly by climate change mainly through changes in precipitation and indirectly by the biological effects of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) through changes in vegetation water use.",
            "Previous studies of climate change impact on hydrology have focused on the direct impact and little has been reported in the literature on catchment-scale the indirect impact.",
            "In this study, we calibrated an ecohydrological model (WAVES) and used this model to estimate the direct and indirect effects and the interactive effect between climate change and eCO2 on water availability in four different catchments in Australia with contrasting climate regime and vegetation cover.",
            "These catchments were: a water-limited forest catchment and an energy-limited forest catchment, a water-limited grass catchment and an energy-limited grass catchment.",
            "The future meteorological forcing was projected from 12 GCMs representing a period centred on 2050s and future CO2 concentration was set as 550ppm.",
            "Modelling experiments show that impacts of eCO2 and projected climate change on vegetation growth, evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff were in the same magnitude but opposite directions in all four catchments, except for the effects on runoff in the energy-limited grass catchment.",
            "Predicted responses of runoff to eCO2 indicate that eCO2 increased runoff in the energy-limited forest catchment by \u223c2% but decreased runoff in other three catchments from 1% to 18%.",
            "This study indicates that rising CO2 increases ecosystem water use efficiency but it does not necessarily result in increased runoff because elevated CO2 also stimulates vegetation growth and increases ET.",
            "Elevated CO2 was proved to have greater impacts on runoff than climate change in the forest catchments.",
            "Modelling experiments also suggest that interactive effects between climate and CO2 are important, especially for predicting leaf area index (LAI) and ET in grassland catchments or runoff in water-limited catchments, where interactive effects were 1\u20136%.",
            "It implies that the assumption that linear combination of individual effects in most of previous studies is not appropriate.",
            "This study highlights the importance of considering elevated CO2 in assessing climate change impacts on catchment-scale water balance and failure to account for direct eCO2 effect or its interactive effects can lead to large bias in the predictions of future water budgets, especially for the water-limited catchments in Australia."

            "Abstract",
            "There has been a long history of subjecting marginalized women to forced and coerced sterilization.",
            "In recent years, the practice has been documented in countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.",
            "It has targeted women who are ethnic and racial minorities, women with disabilities, women living with HIV, and poor women.",
            "A handful of courts have issued decisions on the recent forced sterilization of marginalized women finding that such actions violate the women's rights.",
            "However, they have all failed to address the women's claims of discrimination.",
            "The failure to acknowledge that forced sterilization is at its core a violation of the prohibition of discrimination undermines efforts to eradicate the practice.",
            "It further fails to recognize that coerced and forced sterilization fundamentally seeks to deny women deemed as \"unworthy\" the ability to procreate.",
            "Four key principles outlined in the human rights in patient care framework highlight the importance of a finding that the prohibition of discrimination was violated in cases of forced sterilization: the need to highlight the vulnerability of marginalized populations to discrimination in health care settings; the importance of the rights of medical providers; the role of the state in addressing systemic human rights violations in health care settings; and the application of human rights to patient care.",
            "Based on these principles, it is clear that finding a violation of the prohibition of discrimination in forced sterilization cases is critical in addressing the systemic nature of the practice, acknowledging the marginalization of specific groups and effectively ending forced sterilization through addressing the underlying purpose of the practice.",
            "If litigators, non-governmental organizations and judicial officers are mindful of these principles when dealing with cases of forced sterilization, it is likely that they will be better able to eradicate forced sterilization."

            "The ski industry in Colorado is the largest in the United States and makes up a significant portion of the state\u2019s tourism revenue, but changes in the climate threaten the future of this highly weather-dependent business.",
            "In recent years, many ski resorts have taken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to mitigate the effects shorter winters, less snowfall, and continued drought are having on the future viability of the industry.",
            "Energy efficiency and renewable energy projects are common strategies to reduce emissions; less common, however, are resort-wide analyses of distributed generation (DG) systems combining traditional and alternative energy sources.",
            "The intent of this study is to evaluate the economic and technical feasibility of a hybrid conventional-renewable DG system at Vail Resort.",
            "Electrical and thermal loads for Vail\u2019s mountain operations were used to analyze three DG technologies; combined heat and power (CHP), photovoltaics (PV), and horizontal axis wind turbines.",
            "Technologies were chosen based on a resource assessment as well as input from site managers and analyzed using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER).",
            "The results indicate that the most cost-competitive DG system is a 700 kilowatt (kW) natural gas-fired CHP plant used to meet the site\u2019s base load during the summer months.",
            "Although CHP systems are generally most effective at displacing conventional grid-based power for facilities with little seasonal load variation, the findings of this study align closely with an existing system at Snowbird Resort in Utah.",
            "A small 700 kW CHP system could provide approximately 31% of annual electricity use and 24% of annual thermal energy needs based on the energy model used in this analysis.",
            "Furthermore, annual energy costs could be reduced by 3% and carbon emissions by 11%.",
            "Additional analyses are needed to more precisely determine the optimal system for Vail and the authors recommend that future studies include the energy use from base operations in addition to the mountain area considered in this analysis.",
            "The additional base area energy load during the summer could potentially make a larger CHP system more viable with subsequent cost and carbon emission savings.",
            "Additionally, site-specific resource data such as biomass production and ridge top wind speeds could aid in more definitively eliminating these technologies from consideration."

            "In many countries where FGM/C is traditionally practiced, the prevalence rates of medicalization are increasing, and in countries of migration, such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America or Sweden, court cases or the repeated issuing of statements in favor of presumed minimal forms of FGM/C to replace more invasive forms, has raised the debate between the medical harm reduction arguments and the human rights approach.",
            "Main body: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the arguments associated with the medicalization of FGM/C, a trend that could undermine the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 5.3.",
            "The paper uses four country case studies, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya and UK, to discuss the reasons for engaging in medicalized forms of FGM/C, or not, and explores the ongoing public discourse in those countries concerning harm reduction versus human rights, and the contradiction between medical ethics, national criminal justice systems and international conventions.",
            "The discussion is structured around four key hotly contested ethical dilemmas.",
            "Firstly, that the WHO definition of medicalized FGM/C is too narrow allowing medicalized FGM to be justified by many healthcare professionals as a form of harm reduction which contradicts the medical oath of do no harm.",
            "Secondly, that medicalized FGM/C is a human rights abuse with lifelong consequences, no matter who performs it.",
            "Thirdly, that health care professionals who perform medicalized FGM/C are sustaining cultural norms that they themselves support and are also gaining financially.",
            "Fourthly, the contradiction between protecting traditional cultural rights in legal constitutions versus human rights legislation, which criminalizes FGM/C.",
            "Conclusion: More research needs to be done in order to understand the complexities that are facilitating the medicalization of FGM/C as well as how policy strategies can be strengthened to have a greater de-medicalization impact.",

            "INTRODUCTION",
            "Understanding determinants of gender differences in economic and social domains has been of interest, both in academic and public debates.",
            "Previous research has shown that gender differences in fundamental economic preferences are important in explaining gender differences in economic outcomes, such as for occupational choice, financial investment, or educational decisions, among many others.",
            "However, gaps remain in understanding the sources of gender differences in preferences and their variation.",
            "RATIONALE",
            "We contrasted and tested two hypotheses that make opposite predictions concerning the cross-country association of gender differences in preferences with economic development and gender equality.",
            "On one hand, the attenuation of gender-specific social roles that arises in more developed and gender-egalitarian countries may alleviate differences in preferences between women and men.",
            "As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be negatively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (social role hypothesis).",
            "On the other hand, greater availability of material and social resources removes the gender-neutral goal of subsistence, which creates the scope for gender-specific ambitions and desires.",
            "In addition, more gender-equal access to those resources may allow women and men to express preferences independently from each other.",
            "As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be positively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (resource hypothesis).",
            "We tested these competing predictions using data on experimentally validated measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples.",
            "So that the data would be geographically representative, the dataset was chosen so as to include all continents and a broad range of cultures and economic development levels.",
            "In total, the data represent about 90% of both the world population and global income.",
            "RESULTS",
            "The data revealed substantial cross-country variation in gender differences in preferences.",
            "Gender differences were found to be strongly positively associated with economic development as well as gender equality.",
            "These relationships held for each preference separately as well as for a summary index of differences in all preferences jointly.",
            "Quantitatively, this summary index exhibited correlations of 0.67 (P < 0.0001) with log GDP per capita and 0.56 (P < 0.0001) with a Gender Equality Index (a joint measure of four indices of gender equality), respectively.",
            "To isolate the separate impacts of economic development and gender equality, we conducted a conditional analysis, finding a quantitatively large and statistically significant association between gender differences and log GDP per capita conditional on the Gender Equality Index, and vice versa.",
            "These findings remained robust in several validation tests, such as accounting for potential culture-specific survey response behavior, aggregation bias, and nonlinear relationships.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "The reported evidence indicates that higher levels of economic development and gender equality favor the manifestation of gender differences in preferences across countries.",
            "Our results highlight the critical role of availability of material and social resources, as well as gender-equal access to these resources, in facilitating the independent formation and expression of gender-specific preferences."

            "Abstract: Passive solar design in the Pacific Northwest relies greatly on traditions established elsewhere, resisting adoption of distinct regional practices despite growing evidence of their value.",
            "To promote progress toward climate-responsive design in the cloudy, rainy Cascadian corridor, and to gain insight into often-troubled passive solar performance in the region, energy transfer mechanisms underlying the measured performance of four Oregon sunspaces were investigated using EnergyPlus building models.",
            "Air, mass, globe, and soil temperatures, as well as relative humidity and incident solar radiation, were recorded at 10-min intervals in each sunspace from January through June, 2011; models incorporated geometric, material, occupancy, equipment, tree shading, and soil parameters relevant to energy gain and loss.",
            "Models were then validated by comparison with air and mass temperature data: all predicted 84\u201393% of measurement variability.",
            "Output showed that over half of all energy entering each sunspace originated as diffuse solar radiation, and that 60\u201370% of the total was transmitted through shallow-pitched roof glazing, in a pattern contrary to established belief.",
            "Similarly, much stored energy was lost through central rather than perimeter floor mass.",
            "Orientation exerted a minor effect on performance compared to other factors, particularly tree shading, while solar gain exceeded predictions of long-accepted methods by factors of two to three.",
            "Together, these results show that substantial revision of deep-rooted ideas and expectations will be needed to achieve high-performance passive solar heating in the Pacific Northwest."

            "Objectives",
            "We tested 4 main predictions, derived from life history theory and self-evident human diurnality, regarding maternal sleep behaviors in a non-industrialized population in which mother-nursling co-sleeping is universal and prolonged: (1) Night breastfeeding incurs a sleep cost to co-sleeping mothers; (2) Night breastfeeding increases with infant age, causing mothers to sleep less; (3) Sleep duration co-varies with darkness duration; (4) Access to electricity reduces sleep duration.",
            "Design",
            "Mothers self-recorded and reported nursing and sleep behaviors for a 48-hour period once per month (median\u202f=\u202f5\u202fmonths).",

            "Results",
            "Maternal sleep duration covaried with darkness duration.",
            "Sleep duration was shorter in those with access to electricity (ie, living nearer to town) than those without access (more distant homesteads).",
            "Night breastfeeding rate was fairly steady until it began to decline after the first year postpartum.",
            "At a given infant age, higher night breastfeeding rates were associated with less maternal sleep.",

            "During the first year postpartum, more frequent night nursing shortens maternal sleep more than any other predictor variable.",
            "For older infants, the effect of night nursing diminishes, and even modest \u201cmodernization\u201d (eg, access to electricity) is associated with shorter maternal sleep."

            "In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), as of 2016, there were nearly one million WLHIV, but the existing evidence of their SRH needs comes from a few individual studies.",
            "This systematic review provides an overview of these women's needs to help define new and/or adapt existing public health strategies to the local context.",
            "This review synthesizes the evidence from the literature on the use of and access to SRHS related to family planning, antenatal care, abortion services and violence against WLHIV in LAC.",
            "Methods: Using a systematic review of mixed studies, a search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, INASP, POPLINE, SCOPUS, for studies conducted in LAC, from 2004 to 2017, as well as contact with authors and hand search as needed.",
            "Two independent reviewers evaluated the quality of the studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool; inclusion was conducted according to the PRISMA flow diagram.",

            "Results: A total of 18 studies in 13 LAC countries for a population of 5672 WLHIV were included.",
            "Data from individual studies reported unmet family planning needs; higher, but inconsistent use of condom as the sole contraceptive method OR=1.46 [1.26 to 1.69]; lesser use of other non-permanent contraceptive methods OR=0.26 [0.22 to 0.31]; more unplanned pregnancies OR=1.30 [1.02 to 1.66]; more induced abortions OR=1.96 [1.60 to 2.39]; higher risk of immediate postpartum sterilization; and higher exposure to sexual and institutional violence by WLHIV when compared with women without HIV.",
            "Conclusions: This review presents evidence from LAC about the SRH unmet needs of WLHIV that must be addressed by decreasing institutional and structural barriers, facilitating services and reducing stigma, and discrimination among healthcare providers to improve access to SRHS based on human rights, so women independently of their HIV status can make their own reproductive decisions, free of violence and coercion."

            "Abstract: The response of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise during the twenty-first century remains uncertain.",
            "Global-scale projections suggest that between 20 and 90 per cent (for low and high sea-level rise scenarios, respectively) of the present-day coastal wetland area will be lost, which will in turn result in the loss of biodiversity and highly valued ecosystem services.",
            "These projections do not necessarily take into account all essential geomorphological and socio-economic system feedbacks8.",
            "Here we present an integrated global modelling approach that considers both the ability of coastal wetlands to build up vertically by sediment accretion, and the accommodation space, namely, the vertical and lateral space available for fine sediments to accumulate and be colonized by wetland vegetation.",
            "We use this approach to assess global-scale changes in coastal wetland area in response to global sea-level rise and anthropogenic coastal occupation during the twenty-first century.",
            "On the basis of our simulations, we find that, globally, rather than losses, wetland gains of up to 60 per cent of the current area are possible, if more than 37 per cent (our upper estimate for current accommodation space) of coastal wetlands have sufficient accommodation space, and sediment supply remains at present levels.",
            "In contrast to previous studies, we project that until 2100, the loss of global coastal wetland area will range between 0 and 30 per cent, assuming no further accommodation space in addition to current levels.",
            "Our simulations suggest that the resilience of global wetlands is primarily driven by the availability of accommodation space, which is strongly influenced by the building of anthropogenic infrastructure in the coastal zone and such infrastructure is expected to change over the twenty-first century.",
            "Rather than being an inevitable consequence of global sea-level rise, our findings indicate that large-scale loss of coastal wetlands might be avoidable, if sufficient additional accommodation space can be created through careful nature-based adaptation solutions to coastal management."

            "Abstract",
            "Background: While in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia, higher education and research institutions are widely engaged with the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science to advance gender equality, empirical research on this process and its impact is rare.",
            "This study combined two data sets (free- text comments from a survey and qualitative interviews) to explore the range of experiences and perceptions of participation in Athena SWAN in medical science departments of a research-intensive university in Oxford, United Kingdom.",
            "Methods: The study is based on the secondary analysis of data from two projects: 59 respondents to an anonymous online survey (42 women, 17 men) provided relevant free-text comments and, separately, 37 women participated in face-to-face narrative interviews.",
            "Free-text survey comments and narrative interviews were analysed thematically using constant comparison.",
            "Results: Both women and men said that participation in Athena SWAN had brought about important structural and cultural changes, including increased support for women's careers, greater appreciation of caring responsibilities, and efforts to challenge discrimination and bias.",
            "Many said that these positive changes would not have happened without linkage of Athena SWAN to government research funding, while others thought there were unintended consequences.",
            "Concerns about the programme design and implementation included a perception that Athena SWAN has limited ability to address longstanding and entrenched power and pay imbalances, persisting lack of work-life balance in academic medicine, questions about the sustainability of positive changes, belief that achieving the award could become an end in itself, resentment about perceived positive discrimination, and perceptions that further structural and cultural changes were needed in the university and wider society.",
            "Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that Athena SWAN has a positive impact in advancing gender equality, but there may be limits to how much it can improve gender equality without wider institutional and societal changes.",
            "To address the fundamental causes of gender inequality would require cultural change and welfare state policies incentivising men to increase their participation in unpaid work in the family, which is beyond the scope of higher education and research policy."

            "To date, no systematic assessment of impacts on HAP of \u2018improved\u2019 stove and clean fuel interventions has been conducted.",

            "This systematic review synthesizes evidence for changes in kitchen and personal PM2.5 and carbon monoxide (CO) following introduction of \u2018improved\u2019 solid fuel stoves and cleaner fuels in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).",
            "Methods",
            "Searches of published and unpublished literature were conducted through databases and specialist websites.",
            "Eligible studies reported mean (24 or 48 h) small particulate matter (majority PM2.5) and/or CO.",
            "Eligible interventions were solid fuel stoves (with/without chimneys, advanced combustion), clean fuels (liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, ethanol, electricity, solar) and mixed.",
            "Data extraction and quality appraisal were undertaken using standardized forms, and publication bias assessed.",
            "Baseline and post-intervention values and percentage changes were tabulated and weighted averages calculated.",
            "Meta-analyses of absolute changes in PM and CO were conducted.",
            "Results",
            "Most of the 42 included studies (112 estimates) addressed solid fuel stoves.",
            "Large reductions in pooled kitchen PM2.5 (ranging from 41% (29\u201350%) for advanced combustion stoves to 83% (64\u201394%) for ethanol stoves), and CO (ranging from 39% (11\u201355%) for solid fuel stoves without chimneys to 82% (75\u201395%) for ethanol stoves.",
            "Reductions in personal exposure of 55% (19\u201387%) and 52% (\u2212 7\u201369%) for PM2.5 and CO respectively, were observed for solid fuel stoves with chimneys.",
            "For the majority of interventions, post-intervention kitchen PM2.5 levels remained well above WHO air quality guideline (AQG) limit values, although most met the AQG limit value for CO. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not substantially alter findings; publication bias was evident for chimney stove interventions but this was restricted to before-and-after studies.",
            "Conclusions",
            "In everyday use in LMIC, neither \u2018improved\u2019 solid fuel stoves nor clean fuels (probably due to neighbourhood contamination) achieve PM2.5 concentrations close to 24-hour AQG limit values.",

            "Abstract",
            "This paper explains some adverse effects due to a massive injection of renewables when electricity storage is not available, such as a fall of electricity prices on the spot market or a crowding-out effect for nuclear power stations due to the merit order logic.",
            "From the French experience, it presents a model that calculates the additional cost of electricity production when the share of nuclear generation is reduced to 50% instead of 72% today and when, in compensation, renewable energy (wind and solar) is stored either by batteries or by power-to-gas.",
            "The simulations minimize the cost of the energy mix by optimizing the electricity storage mix: batteries (daily storage) and Power-to-Gas/Gas-to-Power (seasonal storage).",
            "The paper also estimates the negative externalities of intermittent renewable energies that lie in between 44 and 107 \u20ac/MWh.",
            "It also examines the impact on the merit order when those negative externalities are accounted for.",
            "Finally, the simulation results lead us to provide some recommendations concerning R&D electricity storage policy and electricity mix fine tuning."

            "Much gender and development literature blames entrenched \u201ctraditional\u201d gender roles and norms, using them to explain slow progress towards gender and development goals, such as girls\u2019 and women's education, women's participation in public decision-making, and women's land and property ownership.",

            "However, limited research examines the full range of ways in which people, who live in highly gender-unequal societies, actually use traditional gender narratives to negotiate issues of women's empowerment and gender equality.",
            "Drawing on qualitative data collected from three rural South Sudanese communities\u2014comprising interviews and focus groups with 94 research participants, and over five hours of community radio content\u2014this study demonstrates that gender narratives considered to be traditional by the South Sudanese, during a post-conflict transition period, do not necessarily constitute barriers to the advancement of gender and development goals.",

            "By providing evidence that traditional gender narratives are mobilized and used by community members to support women's equality and empowerment, this paper challenges and extends development scholarship that positions traditional narratives as barriers, and encourages development practitioners to consider how they might critically harness, rather than reject, such narratives in the pursuit of gender and development goals."

            "The 9.1-year cycle is shown to be likely related to a decadal Soli/Lunar tidal oscillation, while the 10\u201310.5, 20\u201321 and 60\u201362 year cycles are synchronous to solar and heliospheric planetary oscillations.",
            "We show that the IPCC GCM's claim that all warming observed from 1970 to 2000 has been anthropogenically induced is erroneous because of the GCM failure in reconstructing the quasi 20-year and 60-year climatic cycles.",

            "By combining this corrected trend with the natural cycles, we show that the temperature may not significantly increase during the next 30 years mostly because of the negative phase of the 60-year cycle.",
            "If multisecular natural cycles (which according to some authors have significantly contributed to the observed 1700\u20132010 warming and may contribute to an additional natural cooling by 2100) are ignored, the same IPCC projected anthropogenic emissions would imply a global warming by about 0.3\u20131.2\u00b0C by 2100, contrary to the IPCC 1.0\u20133.6\u00b0C projected warming.",
            "The results of this paper reinforce previous claims that the relevant physical mechanisms that explain the detected climatic cycles are still missing in the current GCMs and that climate variations at the multidecadal scales are astronomically induced and, in first approximation, can be forecast."

            "Background",
            "Access to, and sustained adoption of, clean household fuels at scale remains an aspirational goal to achieve sufficient reductions in household air pollution (HAP) in order to impact on the substantial global health burden caused by reliance on solid fuels.",
            "Aim and objectives",
            "To systematically appraise the current evidence base to identify: (i) which factors enable or limit adoption and sustained use of clean fuels (namely liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, solar cooking and alcohol fuels) in low- and middle-income countries; (ii) lessons learnt concerning equitable scaling-up of programmes of cleaner cooking fuels in relation to poverty, urban\u2013rural settings and gender.",
            "Methods",
            "A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted using established review methodology and extensive searches of published and grey literature sources.",
            "Data extraction and quality appraisal of quantitative, qualitative and case studies meeting inclusion criteria were conducted using standardised methods with reliability checking.",
            "Findings",
            "Forty-four studies from Africa, Asia and Latin America met the inclusion criteria (17 on biogas, 12 on LPG, 9 on solar, 6 on alcohol fuels).",
            "A broad range of inter-related enabling and limiting factors were identified for all four types of intervention, operating across seven pre-specified domains (i.e.",
            "fuel and technology characteristics, household and setting characteristics, knowledge and perceptions, financial, tax and subsidy aspects, market development, regulation, legislation and standards, and programme and policy mechanisms) and multiple levels (i.e.",
            "household, community, national).",
            "All domains matter and the majority of factors are common to all clean fuels interventions reviewed although some are fuel and technology-specific.",
            "All factors should therefore be taken into account and carefully assessed during planning and implementation of any small- and large-scale initiative aiming at promoting clean fuels for household cooking.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Despite limitations in quantity and quality of the evidence this systematic review provides a useful starting point for the design, delivery and evaluation of programmes to ensure more effective adoption and use of LPG, biogas, alcohol fuels and solar cooking.",

            "During the rainy season, relative to clean fuels, the odds of suffering from ALRI were raised for kerosene (OR 1.64; CI: 0.99, 2.71), coal and charcoal (OR 1.54; CI: 1.21, 1.97), wood (OR 1.20; CI: 0.95, 1.51) and lower-grade biomass fuels (OR 1.49; CI: 0.93, 2.35).",
            "In contrast, during the dry season the corresponding odds were reduced for kerosene (OR 1.23; CI: 0.77, 1.95), coal and charcoal (OR 1.35; CI: 1.06, 1.72) and lower-grade biomass fuels (OR 1.07; CI: 0.69, 1.66) but increased for wood (OR 1.32; CI: 1.04, 1.66).",
            "Cooking location also emerged as a season-dependent statistically significant (p = 0.0070) determinant of ALRI, in particular cooking indoors without a separate kitchen during the rainy season (OR 1.80; CI: 1.30, 2.50).",
            "Due to infrequent use in Africa we could, however, not demonstrate an effect of stove ventilation.",
            "Conclusions",
            "We found differential and season-dependent risks for different types of solid fuels and kerosene as well as cooking location on child ALRI.",

            "Background: 2.8 billion people use solid fuels as their primary cooking fuel; the resulting high levels of household air pollution (HAP) were estimated to cause more than 4 million premature deaths in 2012.",
            "The people most affected are among the world's poorest, and past experience has shown that securing adoption and sustained use of effective, low-emission stove technologies and fuels in such populations is not easy.",
            "Among the questions raised by these challenges are (i) to what levels does HAP exposure need to be reduced in order to ensure that substantial health benefits are achieved, and (ii) what intervention technologies and fuels can achieve the required levels of HAP in practice?",

            "The centre of the range of AR4-projected global warming was approximately 4\u00b0C.",
            "The higher end of the projected warming was associated with the higher emissions scenarios and models, which included stronger carbon-cycle feedbacks.",
