            "BACKGROUND",
            "The World Health Organization's (WHO's) Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework is an holistic, settings-based approach to promoting health and educational attainment in school.",
            "The effectiveness of this approach has not been previously rigorously reviewed.",
            "OBJECTIVES",
            "To assess the effectiveness of the Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework in improving the health and well-being of students and their academic achievement.",
            "SEARCH METHODS",
            "We searched the following electronic databases in January 2011 and again in March and April 2013: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Campbell Library, ASSIA, BiblioMap, CAB Abstracts, IBSS, Social Science Citation Index, Sociological Abstracts, TRoPHI, Global Health Database, SIGLE, Australian Education Index, British Education Index, Education Resources Information Centre, Database of Education Research, Dissertation Express, Index to Theses in Great Britain and Ireland, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current controlled trials, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.",
            "We also searched relevant websites, handsearched reference lists, and used citation tracking to identify other relevant articles.",
            "SELECTION CRITERIA",
            "We included cluster-randomised controlled trials where randomisation took place at the level of school, district or other geographical area.",
            "Participants were children and young people aged four to 18 years, attending schools or colleges.",
            "In this review, we define HPS interventions as comprising the following three elements: input to the curriculum; changes to the school's ethos or environment or both; and engagement with families or communities, or both.",
            "We compared this intervention against schools that implemented either no intervention or continued with their usual practice, or any programme that included just one or two of the above mentioned HPS elements.",
            "DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS",
            "At least two review authors identified relevant trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in the trials.",
            "We grouped different types of interventions according to the health topic targeted or the approach used, or both.",
            "Where data permitted, we performed random-effects meta-analyses to provide a summary of results across studies.",
            "MAIN RESULTS",
            "We included 67 eligible cluster trials, randomising 1443 schools or districts.",
            "This is made up of 1345 schools and 98 districts.",
            "The studies tackled a range of health issues: physical activity (4), nutrition (12), physical activity and nutrition combined (18), bullying (7), tobacco (5), alcohol (2), sexual health (2), violence (2), mental health (2), hand-washing (2), multiple risk behaviours (7), cycle-helmet use (1), eating disorders (1), sun protection (1), and oral health (1).",
            "The quality of evidence overall was low to moderate as determined by the GRADE approach.",
            "'Risk of bias' assessments identified methodological limitations, including heavy reliance on self-reported data and high attrition rates for some studies.",
            "In addition, there was a lack of long-term follow-up data for most studies.We found positive effects for some interventions for: body mass index (BMI), physical activity, physical fitness, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, and being bullied.",
            "Intervention effects were generally small but have the potential to produce public health benefits at the population level.",
            "We found little evidence of effectiveness for standardised body mass index (zBMI) and no evidence of effectiveness for fat intake, alcohol use, drug use, mental health, violence and bullying others; however, only a small number of studies focused on these latter outcomes.",
            "It was not possible to meta-analyse data on other health outcomes due to lack of data.",
            "Few studies provided details on adverse events or outcomes related to the interventions.",
            "In addition, few studies included any academic, attendance or school-related outcomes.",
            "We therefore cannot draw any clear conclusions as to the effectiveness of this approach for improving academic achievement.",
            "AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS",
            "The results of this review provide evidence for the effectiveness of some interventions based on the HPS framework for improving certain health outcomes but not others.",

            "Abstract",
            "Policy Points Current efforts to reduce infant mortality and improve infant health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can benefit from awareness of the history of successful early 20th-century initiatives to reduce infant mortality in high-income countries, which occurred before widespread use of vaccination and medical technologies.",
            "Improvements in sanitation, civil registration, milk purification, and institutional structures to monitor and reduce infant mortality played a crucial role in the decline in infant mortality seen in the United States in the early 1900s.",
            "The commitment to sanitation and civil registration has not been fulfilled in many LMICs.",
            "Structural investments in sanitation and water purification as well as in civil registration systems should be central, not peripheral, to the goal of infant mortality reduction in LMICs.",
            "Context: Between 1915 and 1950, the infant mortality rate (IMR) in the United States declined from 100 to fewer than 30 deaths per 1,000 live births, prior to the widespread use of medical technologies and vaccination.",
            "In 2015 the IMR in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) was 53.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is comparable to the United States in 1935 when IMR was 55.7 deaths per 1,000 live births.",
            "We contrast the role of public health institutions and interventions for IMR reduction in past versus present efforts to reduce infant mortality in LMICs to critically examine the current evidence base for reducing infant mortality and to propose ways in which lessons from history can inform efforts to address the current burden of infant mortality.",
            "Methods: We searched the peer-reviewed and gray literature on the causes and explanations behind the decline in infant mortality in the United States between 1850 and 1950 and in LMICs after 2000.",
            "We included historical analyses, empirical research, policy documents, and global strategies.",
            "For each key source, we assessed the factors considered by their authors to be salient in reducing infant mortality.",
            "Findings: Public health programs that played a central role in the decline in infant mortality in the United States in the early 1900s emphasized large structural interventions like filtering and chlorinating water supplies, building sanitation systems, developing the birth and death registration area, pasteurizing milk, and also educating mothers on infant care and hygiene.",
            "The creation of new institutions and policies for infant health additionally provided technical expertise, mobilized resources, and engaged women's groups and public health professionals.",

            "Background: Clinicians, scientists, and policy makers are increasingly taking interest in the long-term outcomes of early intervention programs undertaken during the 1960s and 1970s, which were intended to improve young children's health and educational prospects.",
            "The Brookline Early Education Project (BEEP) was an innovative, community-based program that provided health and developmental services for children and their families from 3 months before birth until entry into kindergarten.",
            "It was open to all families in the town of Brookline and to families from neighboring Boston, to include a mixture of families from suburban and urban communities.",
            "The goal of the project, which was administered by the Brookline Public Schools, was to ensure that children would enter kindergarten healthy and ready to learn.",
            "Objective: Outcome studies of BEEP and comparison children during kindergarten and second grade demonstrated the program's effectiveness during the early school years.",
            "The goal of this follow-up study was to test the hypotheses that BEEP participants, in comparison with their peers, would have higher levels of educational attainment, higher incomes, and more positive health behaviors, mental health, and health efficacy during the young adult period.",
            "Methods: Participants were young adults who were enrolled in the BEEP project from 1973 to 1978.",
            "Comparison subjects were young adults in Boston and Brookline who did not participate in BEEP but were matched to the BEEP group with respect to age, ethnicity, mother's educational level, and neighborhood (during youth).",

            "The follow-up sample included a total of 120 young adults who had participated in BEEP as children.",
            "The sample differed from the original BEEP sample in having a slightly larger proportion of college-educated mothers and a slightly smaller proportion of urban families but otherwise resembled the original BEEP sample.",
            "The demographic features of the BEEP and comparison samples were similar.",
            "The young adults were asked to complete a survey that focused on the major domains of educational/functional outcomes and health/well-being.",

            "Fewer BEEP young adults reported having a low income (less than 20000 dollars); the income differences were accounted for largely by the urban participants.",
            "The percentage of subjects with private health insurance was significantly lower in the urban group overall, but the BEEP urban group had higher rates of private insurance than did the comparison group.",
            "More than 80% of both suburban samples reported being in very good or excellent health; the 2 urban groups had significantly lower ratings, with 64% of the BEEP group and only 41.67% of the comparison group reaching this standard.",
            "Overall, suburban participants reported more positive health behaviors, more perceived competence, and less depression.",
            "Among the urban samples, however, participation in BEEP was associated with higher levels of health efficacy, more positive health behaviors, and less depression than their peers.",

            "BEEP participants living in urban communities had advantages over their peers in educational attainment, income, health, and well-being.",
            "The educational advantages found for BEEP participants in the early years of schooling included executive skills such as planning, organizing, and completing school-related tasks.",
            "It is likely that these early advantages in executive function extended beyond education-related tasks to other activities as participants became responsible for their own lives.",
            "The long-term benefits revealed in this study are consistent with the findings of previous long-term studies that indicated that participants in high-quality intervention programs are less likely to cost taxpayers money for health, educational, and public assistance services.",

            "Design: Analysis of covariance was used to compare changes, from late FY 1995 through early FY 1998, in access to VA services in counties in which new primary care clinics were located, in counties in which clinics that included specialized mental health components were located, and for comparison, in other U.S. counties, adjusting for potentially confounding factors.",

            "Abstract",
            "This article aims to do two things.",
            "First, it argues that moralization of health occurs not only at the practical level of individual healthcare choices and health states, but also at the conceptual level of health itself.",
            "This is most evident in cases where the concept of health is presumed to possess the property of \"overridingness\" when compared to competing values and norms, that is, when it is treated as taking precedence over other values and norms it may come into conflict with.",
            "Second, the article makes a case for being critically skeptical of specific deployments of the concept of health when it has been moralized in this way.",
            "In such cases, what typically results is that some other personal value/norm, or set of values/norms, held by the individual is treated as intrinsically at odds with the concept of health, which is presumed, uncritically, to be superior, often because it is taken to be free-standing and self-justifying.",
            "Yet, a growing body of evidence-based research suggests that the role played by dimensions of personal meaningfulness in the quality of individuals' overall health is quite underappreciated.",
            "It is useful to think of these dimensions of personal meaning and significance as representing the individual's values.",
            "Thus, taking these data more seriously ought to lead to a reevaluation of the moralization of health at the conceptual level.",
            "In the first place, it is not obvious that if the concept of health runs afoul of other values/norms held by an individual, the latter should automatically yield.",
            "In the second place, they suggest that other values/norms held by an individual are not necessarily intrinsically opposed to the concept of health, but in fact may go a good distance in support of it.",

            "Results: Empirical evidence strongly supports the assumption of insecure attachment in SUD samples.",
            "With regard to specific patterns of attachment, results mainly point towards fearful and dismissing-avoidance, whereas single studies report preoccupied and unresolved patterns. Results indicate different patterns of attachment in different groups of substance abusers, that is, fearful-avoidant attachment in heroin addicts and more heterogeneous results in abusers of other substances.",

            "Evaluating strategies for control of tuberculosis in prisons and prevention of spillover into communities: An observational and modeling study from Brazil",
            "Background: It has been hypothesized that prisons serve as amplifiers of general tuberculosis (TB) epidemics, but there is a paucity of data on this phenomenon and the potential population-level effects of prison-focused interventions.",
            "This study (1) quantifies the TB risk for prisoners as they traverse incarceration and release, (2) mathematically models the impact of prison-based interventions on TB burden in the general population, and (3) generalizes this model to a wide range of epidemiological contexts.",
            "Methods and findings: We obtained individual-level incarceration data for all inmates (n = 42,925) and all reported TB cases (n = 5,643) in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul from 2007 through 2013.",
            "We matched individuals between prisoner and TB databases and estimated the incidence of TB from the time of incarceration and the time of prison release using Cox proportional hazards models.",
            "We identified 130 new TB cases diagnosed during incarceration and 170 among individuals released from prison.",
            "During imprisonment, TB rates increased from 111 cases per 100,000 person-years at entry to a maximum of 1,303 per 100,000 person-years at 5.2 years.",
            "At release, TB incidence was 229 per 100,000 person-years, which declined to 42 per 100,000 person-years (the average TB incidence in Brazil) after 7 years.",
            "We used these data to populate a compartmental model of TB transmission and incarceration to evaluate the effects of various prison-based interventions on the incidence of TB among prisoners and the general population.",
            "Annual mass TB screening within Brazilian prisons would reduce TB incidence in prisons by 47.4% (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI], 44.4%-52.5%) and in the general population by 19.4% (95% BCI 17.9%-24.2%).",
            "A generalized model demonstrates that prison-based interventions would have maximum effectiveness in reducing community incidence in populations with a high concentration of TB in prisons and greater degrees of mixing between ex-prisoners and community members.",
            "Study limitations include our focus on a single Brazilian state and our retrospective use of administrative databases.",
            "Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prison environment, more so than the prison population itself, drives TB incidence, and targeted interventions within prisons could have a substantial effect on the broader TB epidemic."

            "Introduction:                    Air pollution concentrations in most of the megacities in India exceed the air quality guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization and may adversely affect human health in these cities.",
            "Particulate matter (PM) is the pollutant of concern in many Indian cities, particularly in the capital city of Delhi, In recent years, several actions have been taken to address the growing air pollution problem in Delhi and other Indian cities; however, few studies have been designed to assess the health effects of air pollution in Indian cities.",
            "To bridge the gap in scientific knowledge and add evidence to the ongoing studies in other Asian cities, a retrospective time-series study on air pollution and mortality in Delhi was initiated under the HEI Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA) program.",
            "Approach:                    The study used retrospective time-series data of air quality and of naturally-occurring deaths recorded in Delhi to identify changes in the daily all-natural-cause mortality rate that could be attributed to changes in air quality.",
            "The 3-year study period included the years 2002 through 2004.",
            "The methodology involved: (1) collecting data on ambient air quality for major pollutants from all monitoring stations in Delhi; (2) collecting meteorologic data (temperature, humidity, and visibility); (3) collecting daily mortality records from the Registrar of Births and Deaths; (4) statistically analyzing the data using the common protocol for Indian PAPA studies, which included city-specific modifications.",
            "Results and implications:                    The study findings showed that increased concentrations of PM with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microg/m3 (PM10) and of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were associated with increased all-natural-cause mortality.",
            "It was found that every 10-microg/m3 change in PM10 was associated with only a 0.15% increase in total all-natural-cause mortality.",
            "When NO2 alone was considered in the model, daily all-natural-cause mortality increased 0.84% for every 10-microg/m3 increase in NO2 concentration.",
            "No significant effect was observed for changes in sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations.",
            "The study provides insight into the link between air pollution and mortality in local populations and contributes information to the existing body of knowledge."
