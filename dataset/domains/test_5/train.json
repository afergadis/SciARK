            "Abstract",
            "Background: Mental health literacy (MHL), or the knowledge and abilities necessary to benefit mental health, is a significant determinant of mental health and has the potential to benefit both individual and public mental health.",
            "MHL and its measures have traditionally focused on knowledge and beliefs about mental -ill-health rather than on mental health.",
            "No measures of MHL addressing knowledge of good or positive mental health have been identified.",
            "Aim: This study aimed to develop and validate an instrument measuring adolescents' knowledge of how to obtain and maintain good mental health and to evaluate the psychometric properties of the instrument.",
            "More specifically, the factor structure, internal and construct validity, and test-retest reliability were assessed.",
            "Methods: The participants were Norwegian upper secondary school students aged 15-21 years.",
            "The development and validation of the instrument entailed three phases: 1) item generation based on the basic psychological needs theory (BPNT), focus group interviews, and a narrative literature review, 2) a pilot study (n = 479), and 3) test-retest (n = 149), known-groups validity (n = 44), and scale construction, item reduction through principal component analysis (PCA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for factor structure and psychometric properties assessment (n = 1888).",
            "Results: Thirty-two items were initially generated, and 15 were selected for the pilot study.",
            "PCA identified cross-loadings, and a one-factor solution was examined.",
            "After removing five problematic items, CFA yielded a satisfactory fit for a 10-item one-factor model, referred to as the mental health-promoting knowledge (MHPK-10) measure.",
            "The test-retest evaluation supported the stability of the measure.",
            "McDonald's omega was 0.84, and known-groups validity test indicated good construct validity.",
            "Conclusion: A valid and reliable one-dimensional instrument measuring knowledge of factors promoting good mental health among adolescents was developed.",
            "The instrument has the potential to complement current measures of MHL and may be useful when planning mental health promotion activities and evaluating public mental health education initiatives in adolescents.",

            "Global-scale projections suggest that between 20 and 90 per cent (for low and high sea-level rise scenarios, respectively) of the present-day coastal wetland area will be lost, which will in turn result in the loss of biodiversity and highly valued ecosystem services.",

            "Rather than being an inevitable consequence of global sea-level rise, our findings indicate that large-scale loss of coastal wetlands might be avoidable, if sufficient additional accommodation space can be created through careful nature-based adaptation solutions to coastal management."

            "Abstract",
            "Background",
            "In 2007, the Indonesian Government instigated a national program to convert domestic kerosene users to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking.",
            "This was primarily motivated by the rising cost of kerosene subsidies.",
            "Objective",
            "To review the national conversion program and LPG scale up by evaluating its impacts, including assessing sustained changes in cooking behaviour and consequent reductions in exposure to household air pollution (HAP).",
            "Methods and data sources",
            "Searches of peer-review and grey literature in both English and Bahasa Indonesian were conducted and supplemented by interviews with key informants, data from the National Statistics Agency and results from household surveys.",
            "The data were extracted and analyzed using an Implementation Science approach.",
            "Results",
            "The main kerosene to LPG conversion phase took place in highly populated kerosene dependent areas between 2007 and 2012 reaching over 50 million households, approximately two thirds of all households in Indonesia.",
            "Since then the drive to expand LPG use has continued at a slower pace, especially in more remote provinces where solid fuel is more widely used.",
            "Over 57 million LPG start up kits were distributed as of 2015.",
            "Beginning in 2018, the open subsidy for LPG is expected to be replaced by one targeted at lower income households.",
            "While the main conversion phase has been highlighted as an example of effective and impressively fast fuel switching at scale, the impact on domestic biomass use remains limited.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Addressing HAP and the health impacts associated with kerosene and biomass use was never an objective of the program.",
            "Consequently, there is limited evidence of impact in this area, and in hindsight, missed opportunities in terms of influencing cooking behaviour change among biomass users, who are more at risk."

            "The ski industry in Colorado is the largest in the United States and makes up a significant portion of the state\u2019s tourism revenue, but changes in the climate threaten the future of this highly weather-dependent business.",
            "In recent years, many ski resorts have taken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to mitigate the effects shorter winters, less snowfall, and continued drought are having on the future viability of the industry.",
            "Energy efficiency and renewable energy projects are common strategies to reduce emissions; less common, however, are resort-wide analyses of distributed generation (DG) systems combining traditional and alternative energy sources.",
            "The intent of this study is to evaluate the economic and technical feasibility of a hybrid conventional-renewable DG system at Vail Resort.",
            "Electrical and thermal loads for Vail\u2019s mountain operations were used to analyze three DG technologies; combined heat and power (CHP), photovoltaics (PV), and horizontal axis wind turbines.",
            "Technologies were chosen based on a resource assessment as well as input from site managers and analyzed using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER).",
            "The results indicate that the most cost-competitive DG system is a 700 kilowatt (kW) natural gas-fired CHP plant used to meet the site\u2019s base load during the summer months.",
            "Although CHP systems are generally most effective at displacing conventional grid-based power for facilities with little seasonal load variation, the findings of this study align closely with an existing system at Snowbird Resort in Utah.",
            "A small 700 kW CHP system could provide approximately 31% of annual electricity use and 24% of annual thermal energy needs based on the energy model used in this analysis.",
            "Furthermore, annual energy costs could be reduced by 3% and carbon emissions by 11%.",
            "Additional analyses are needed to more precisely determine the optimal system for Vail and the authors recommend that future studies include the energy use from base operations in addition to the mountain area considered in this analysis.",
            "The additional base area energy load during the summer could potentially make a larger CHP system more viable with subsequent cost and carbon emission savings.",
            "Additionally, site-specific resource data such as biomass production and ridge top wind speeds could aid in more definitively eliminating these technologies from consideration."

            "This represents waste of valuable resources and could lead to higher environmental impacts compared to energy recovered by incineration, even if the landfill gas is recovered.",
            "Using life cycle assessment (LCA) as a tool, this paper aims to find out which of the following two options for MSW disposal is more environmentally sustainable: incineration or recovery of biogas from landfills, each producing either electricity or co-generating heat and electricity.",
            "The systems are compared on a life cycle basis for two functional units: \u2018disposal of 1 tonne of MSW\u2019 and \u2018generation of 1kWh of electricity\u2019.",
            "The results indicate that, if both systems are credited for their respective recovered energy and recyclable materials, energy from incineration has much lower impacts than from landfill biogas across all impact categories, except for human toxicity.",
            "The impacts of incineration co-generating heat and electricity are negative for nine out of 11 categories as the avoided impacts for the recovered energy and materials are higher than those caused by incineration.",
            "By improving the recovery rate of biogas, some impacts of landfilling, such as global warming, depletion of fossil resources, acidification and photochemical smog, would be significantly reduced.",
            "However, most impacts of the landfill gas would still be higher than the impacts of incineration, except for global warming and human toxicity.",

            "Background and objectives: International health experiences (IHEs) have been associated with improved clinical skills, altruistic attitudes, cross-cultural sensitivity, and exposure to community medicine for residents and medical students.",
            "Although an increasing number of family medicine residencies offer IHEs, there are currently no standardized competencies or guidelines for developing IHEs.",
            "The aim of this study was to examine the content of IHEs in order to provide an overview of the current landscape of global health training in family medicine residency programs.",
            "Methods: Residency programs self-identifying as offering IHEs on the American Medical Association's (AMA) FREIDA Online website were emailed an electronic survey with questions regarding IHE characteristics, resident selection criteria, faculty support, motivations for participation, challenges to implementation, and funding.",
            "Results: Of the 153 programs that responded, 84% still offered IHEs.",
            "Most IHEs are 3--4 weeks (71.1%) and are funded by the resident (74.2%).",

            "Being in good academic standing was the most important eligibility criteria for residents participating in an IHE (86.7%), and funding was reported as the most challenging aspect (62.5%) of offering IHEs.",
            "Conclusions: IHEs are increasing in number and receiving more funding, but the experiences are variable among residency programs.",
            "While most program directors believe residents participate in IHEs to gain exposure with underserved populations, only a small percentage (5.5%) include a commitment to community service as part of a requirement for participation in an IHE."

            "Abstract",
            "Policy Points Current efforts to reduce infant mortality and improve infant health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can benefit from awareness of the history of successful early 20th-century initiatives to reduce infant mortality in high-income countries, which occurred before widespread use of vaccination and medical technologies.",
            "Improvements in sanitation, civil registration, milk purification, and institutional structures to monitor and reduce infant mortality played a crucial role in the decline in infant mortality seen in the United States in the early 1900s.",
            "The commitment to sanitation and civil registration has not been fulfilled in many LMICs.",
            "Structural investments in sanitation and water purification as well as in civil registration systems should be central, not peripheral, to the goal of infant mortality reduction in LMICs.",
            "Context: Between 1915 and 1950, the infant mortality rate (IMR) in the United States declined from 100 to fewer than 30 deaths per 1,000 live births, prior to the widespread use of medical technologies and vaccination.",
            "In 2015 the IMR in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) was 53.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is comparable to the United States in 1935 when IMR was 55.7 deaths per 1,000 live births.",
            "We contrast the role of public health institutions and interventions for IMR reduction in past versus present efforts to reduce infant mortality in LMICs to critically examine the current evidence base for reducing infant mortality and to propose ways in which lessons from history can inform efforts to address the current burden of infant mortality.",
            "Methods: We searched the peer-reviewed and gray literature on the causes and explanations behind the decline in infant mortality in the United States between 1850 and 1950 and in LMICs after 2000.",
            "We included historical analyses, empirical research, policy documents, and global strategies.",
            "For each key source, we assessed the factors considered by their authors to be salient in reducing infant mortality.",
            "Findings: Public health programs that played a central role in the decline in infant mortality in the United States in the early 1900s emphasized large structural interventions like filtering and chlorinating water supplies, building sanitation systems, developing the birth and death registration area, pasteurizing milk, and also educating mothers on infant care and hygiene.",
            "The creation of new institutions and policies for infant health additionally provided technical expertise, mobilized resources, and engaged women's groups and public health professionals.",
            "In contrast, contemporary literature and global policy documents on reducing infant mortality in LMICs have primarily focused on interventions at the individual, household, and health facility level, and on the widespread adoption of cheap, ostensibly accessible, and simple technologies, often at the cost of leaving the structural conditions that determine child survival largely untouched.",
            "Conclusions: Current discourses on infant mortality are not informed by lessons from history.",
            "Although structural interventions were central to the decline in infant mortality in the United States, current interventions in LMICs that receive the most global endorsement do not address these structural determinants of infant mortality.",

            "This article investigates the feasibility of these targets by testing their consistency under possible economic development scenarios.",
            "We analyse these targets from two perspectives: consistency with the overall economic growth and consistency with the international society's expectation on China's greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement responsibilities.",
            "The main findings are: under the recently announced 2020 target of gross domestic product (GDP) that is double the 2010 level, the adoption of a 15% clean energy target could result in excessive primary energy demand; and then with 40\u201345% GDP CO2 intensity reduction, CO2 emissions in 2020 could substantially exceed the International Energy Agency (IEA) 450 ppm scenario for China.",
            "Thus we propose a 17% clean energy target that can reconcile the domestic plan with international expectation.",
            "Our article also outlines the pathways to realise clean energy development into 2020 and proposes policy recommendations."

            "Data analysis was conducted from May 24 to May 27, 2019.",
            "MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-cohort-adjusted suicide mortality rates by year and sex were used as the main outcomes.",
            "These adjusted rates were calculated based on the period effect estimated with the age-period-cohort (APC) modeling method.",
            "Participants' age, yea of birth, and the year when suicide occurred were used as time-related risk factors.",
            "RESULTS: Age-cohort-adjusted suicide mortality rates were estimated successfully by year and by sex.",
            "The adjusted rates were obtained after controlling for a V-shaped cohort effect and a curved age effect that also differed by sex.",
            "The unadjusted suicide mortality rate for male youths increased from 7.4 per 100\u202f000 in 1999 to 10.7 per 100\u202f000 in 2017, while the adjusted rate increased from 4.9 per 100\u202f000 in 1999 to 8.7 per 100\u202f000 in 2017.",
            "The unadjusted suicide mortality rates for female youths were 1.6 per 100\u202f000 in 1999 and 3.5 per 100\u202f000 in 2017, while the adjusted rates were 1.7 per 100\u202f000 in 1999 and 4.2 per 100\u202f000 in 2017.",
            "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this study indicate a more rapid increase and smaller male-female difference in suicide rates among US youths since 1999 than those shown by the unadjusted suicide mortality rates.",
            "The adjusted rates provide unbiased data that are needed for evidence-based decision-making and strategies to curb the increasing suicide rates among US youths."

            "Large-scale projects like these are frequently justified by appeals to grand narratives \u2013 promoting economic growth, securing energy supply, modernizing energy service provision, and transitioning to more environmentally sustainable energy systems - in which the fate of the nation is closely tied to infrastructural development.",
            "The papers in this collection present compelling empirical evidence of how claims for energy infrastructure\u2019s national significance and/or necessity intersect with the (re)production of political and economic power.",
            "Drawing on case material from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe, they highlight the capacity of different energy technologies and infrastructural assemblages to shape political and economic outcomes beyond their role in storing, transporting or transforming energy.",
            "This Introduction to the Special Issue does three things.",
            "First, it characterises the scale and significance of the contemporary \u2018infrastructural moment\u2019, observing how, in many national contexts, energy policy-making remains centralised and divorced from public participation.",

            "Abstract",
            "This article aims to do two things.",
            "First, it argues that moralization of health occurs not only at the practical level of individual healthcare choices and health states, but also at the conceptual level of health itself.",
            "This is most evident in cases where the concept of health is presumed to possess the property of \"overridingness\" when compared to competing values and norms, that is, when it is treated as taking precedence over other values and norms it may come into conflict with.",
            "Second, the article makes a case for being critically skeptical of specific deployments of the concept of health when it has been moralized in this way.",
            "In such cases, what typically results is that some other personal value/norm, or set of values/norms, held by the individual is treated as intrinsically at odds with the concept of health, which is presumed, uncritically, to be superior, often because it is taken to be free-standing and self-justifying.",
            "Yet, a growing body of evidence-based research suggests that the role played by dimensions of personal meaningfulness in the quality of individuals' overall health is quite underappreciated.",
            "It is useful to think of these dimensions of personal meaning and significance as representing the individual's values.",
            "Thus, taking these data more seriously ought to lead to a reevaluation of the moralization of health at the conceptual level.",
            "In the first place, it is not obvious that if the concept of health runs afoul of other values/norms held by an individual, the latter should automatically yield.",
            "In the second place, they suggest that other values/norms held by an individual are not necessarily intrinsically opposed to the concept of health, but in fact may go a good distance in support of it.",
            "Keywords: conceptual moralization of health; cultural values; evidence-based medicine; medical values; moralization of health; overrdingness; responsibilization."

            "The proposed astronomical empirical climate model assumes that the climate is resonating with, or synchronized to a set of natural harmonics that, in previous works (Scafetta, 2010b, 2011b), have been associated to the solar system planetary motion, which is mostly determined by Jupiter and Saturn.",
            "We show that the GCMs fail to reproduce the major decadal and multidecadal oscillations found in the global surface temperature record from 1850 to 2011.",
            "On the contrary, the proposed harmonic model (which herein uses cycles with 9.1, 10\u201310.5, 20\u201321, 60\u201362 year periods) is found to well reconstruct the observed climate oscillations from 1850 to 2011, and it is shown to be able to forecast the climate oscillations from 1950 to 2011 using the data covering the period 1850\u20131950, and vice versa.",
            "The 9.1-year cycle is shown to be likely related to a decadal Soli/Lunar tidal oscillation, while the 10\u201310.5, 20\u201321 and 60\u201362 year cycles are synchronous to solar and heliospheric planetary oscillations.",
            "We show that the IPCC GCM's claim that all warming observed from 1970 to 2000 has been anthropogenically induced is erroneous because of the GCM failure in reconstructing the quasi 20-year and 60-year climatic cycles.",
            "Finally, we show how the presence of these large natural cycles can be used to correct the IPCC projected anthropogenic warming trend for the 21st century.",
            "By combining this corrected trend with the natural cycles, we show that the temperature may not significantly increase during the next 30 years mostly because of the negative phase of the 60-year cycle.",
            "If multisecular natural cycles (which according to some authors have significantly contributed to the observed 1700\u20132010 warming and may contribute to an additional natural cooling by 2100) are ignored, the same IPCC projected anthropogenic emissions would imply a global warming by about 0.3\u20131.2\u00b0C by 2100, contrary to the IPCC 1.0\u20133.6\u00b0C projected warming.",
