            "Design: Qualitative ethnographic design.",
            "Setting: Oneintensive care unit (ICU) of a multiethnic urban hospital in Belgium.",
            "Participants: 84 ICU staff members, 10 patients from ethnic-minority groups and their visiting family members.",
            "Results: Patients had several human basic needs for which they could not sufficiently turn to anybody, neither to their healthcare professionals, nor to their relatives nor to other patients.",
            "These needs included the need for social contact, the need to increase comfort and alleviate pain, the need to express desperation and participate in end-of-life decision making.",
            "Three interrelated risk factors for the development of mental health problems among the patients included were identified: First, healthcare professionals' mainly biomedical care approach (eg, focus on curing the patient, limited psychosocial support), second, the ICU context (eg, time pressure, uncertainty, regulatory frameworks) and third, patients' different ethnocultural background (eg, religious and phenotypical differences).",
            "Conclusions: The mental state of patients from ethnic minority groups during critical care is characterised by extreme emotional loneliness.",
            "It is important that staff should identify and meet patients' unique basic needs in good time with regard to their mental well-being, taking into account important threats related to their own mainly biomedical approach to care, the ICU's structural context as well as the patients' different ethnocultural background.",

            "The transition to cleaner energy sources has seen a much higher penetration of renewable sources of electricity on the grid than ever before.",
            "Among these renewable generation sources are wind and solar power which provide intermittent and often unpredictable energy generation throughout the day depending on weather conditions.",
            "The connection of such renewable sources poses problems for electricity network operators whose legacy systems have been designed to use traditional generation sources where supply can be increased as required to meet demand.",

            "In the first scenario, this hydrogen derives mainly from steam reformation of fossil fuels (principally coal), whereas in the second and third scenarios, hydrogen is made mainly by electrolysis using variable surpluses of low-carbon electricity.",

            "Our dating estimates revealed that most of the diversity of geckos in the archipelago was the consequence of in situ diversification.",
            "However not all genera shared similar patterns of diversification.",
            "While in Hemidactylus and Haemodracon this involved great differences in body size and low levels of climatic diversification (mostly involving sympatric distributions), an opposite pattern appeared in Pristurus in which most of the diversification involved shifts in climatic envelopes (mostly involving allopatric and parapatric distributions) but almost no size differentiation.",

            "Whilst other services and utilities such as sewage, water, drainage and even modern day telecommunications have wisely been designed to be out of sight in the underground infrastructure, solid waste collection has commonly remained unchanged since the 19th century.",
            "Furthermore, traditional municipal waste handling in historical city centres is often made difficult by: old infrastructures; narrow, crooked streets that are not suitable for large waste collection vehicles; little space for rubbish bins, making at source separation difficult, and; high volumes of tourists that make traditional bins less accessible by waste operatives, which often conflicts with the objectives of keeping areas associated with tourism clean and hygienic.",
            "In these circumstances, underground vacuum waste collection arise as a revolutionary solution, even in remote areas.",
            "This waste management model lets integrate waste collection into the infrastructure of a building, a residential development a district or even entire towns, by transporting waste using vacuum technology through an underground network of pipes.",
            "The result, among other positive elements, is an average reduction in CO2 emissions above 90% compared with traditional collection models by truck."

            "We also simulate limited sample effort by randomly removing a percentage of the initial data points (randomly, either throughout the entire range or only in specific part of the simulated range), and show that the technique is robust for the removal of up to 50% of data, or, using a spatial pooling of samples, for the removal of 90% of the data.",

            "Content validity was assessed by reviewing the frequency of complete responses and the distribution of responses to each item.",

            "Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.",

            "Test-retest reliability was assessed at one week using intra-class correlation coefficients.",
            "Susceptibility to bias was measured using the Balanced Inventory of Desired Responding.",
            "Results: WEMWBS showed good content validity.",
            "Confirmatory factor analysis supported the single factor hypothesis.",
            "A Cronbach's alpha score of 0.89 (student sample) and 0.91 (population sample) suggests some item redundancy in the scale.",
            "WEMWBS showed high correlations with other mental health and well-being scales and lower correlations with scales measuring overall health.",
            "Its distribution was near normal and the scale did not show ceiling effects in a population sample.",
            "It discriminated between population groups in a way that is largely consistent with the results of other population surveys.",
            "Test-retest reliability at one week was high (0.83).",
            "Social desirability bias was lower or similar to that of other comparable scales.",
            "Conclusion: WEMWBS is a measure of mental well-being focusing entirely on positive aspects of mental health.",
            "As a short and psychometrically robust scale, with no ceiling effects in a population sample, it offers promise as a tool for monitoring mental well-being at a population level.",
            "Whilst WEMWBS should appeal to those evaluating mental health promotion initiatives, it is important that the scale's sensitivity to change is established before it is recommended in this context."

            "Background: In 2014, United Nations member states proposed a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs) to help further the millennium development goals that they had proposed in New York in 2000.",
            "Of these 13 SDGs, Goal 3 (i.e., SDG 3) was titled \"Good Health and Well-Being.\"",
            "This goal highlighted women's health and well-being via two key objectives.",
            "The first, SDG 3.1, aimed to reduce maternal mortality rates (MMR) and the second, SDG 3.7, aimed to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health care services.",
            "Drawing on all the latest reports, which have been released by Gulf Cooperation Council states (GCC), this paper sheds light on GCC states' work on women's wellbeing through SDG 3.",
            "Aim: the paper aims to review GCC states' work on women's wellbeing in SDG3, which achievements they obtained, which tools they used and which gaps still exist.",
            "The paper aims to explain the socio-cultural background behind these achievements, tools, and gaps.",
            "Methodology: For the purpose of this study, we used narrative review approach through which we reviewed reports from 2017 and 2018 on SDGs published online by the Ministry of Development and Planning of each GCC state, and latest reports of the WHO on the same states.",
            "Findings: the study found similarities and differences between different GCC states, which in turn reveals gaps and areas that are not meeting women's needs.",
            "The findings show that MMR in GCC countries has declined by nearly half.",
            "The main strategies they adopted to address SDG 3.1 included awareness campaigns, improving access to healthcare systems and training professionals.",
            "The tools used to meet SDG 3.7 included training health professionals and raising awareness of consanguinity.",
            "The study reveals several gaps, such as a lack of discussion around challenges and barriers, and a lack of linkage between an SDG and the targets contained within it.",
            "Conclusion: The paper concludes that there is a much greater emphasis on reducing MMR, compared to providing access to sexual and reproductive healthcare.",
            "This difference is due to different socio-cultural framing of each of these two issues."
