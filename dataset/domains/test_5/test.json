            "Abstract",
            "Background/aims: The aim of this prospective study was to estimate gender differences in anxiety, depression, and alcohol use severity among patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) before and after detoxification program and within 12 months after discharge.",
            "Methods: AUD severity, state and trait anxiety, and depression were assessed in 187 patients entering an inpatient alcohol detoxification program.",
            "Follow-up assessments were performed at 6 and 12 months after discharge.",
            "A between- and within-subjects analyses explored gender differences.",
            "The predictive value of anxiety and depression for alcohol relapse was analyzed by logistic and linear regression in both genders.",
            "Results: Females had higher levels of anxiety and depression than males both at admission and after discharge.",
            "Trait anxiety and depression significantly increased 6 months after discharge in males and females respectively.",
            "Both state and trait anxiety levels at the 6-month follow-up predicted alcohol relapse at the 12-month follow-up in males.",
            "Conversely, in females, depression level at the 6-month follow-up was a predictor of relapse at the 12-month follow-up.",
            "Conclusions: In both genders, the psychopathological dimension that showed the most significant worsening at 6-month follow-up (i.e., anxiety in males and depression in females) was found to be a significant predictor of relapse at the 12-month follow-up."

            "It further fails to recognize that coerced and forced sterilization fundamentally seeks to deny women deemed as \"unworthy\" the ability to procreate.",
            "Four key principles outlined in the human rights in patient care framework highlight the importance of a finding that the prohibition of discrimination was violated in cases of forced sterilization: the need to highlight the vulnerability of marginalized populations to discrimination in health care settings; the importance of the rights of medical providers; the role of the state in addressing systemic human rights violations in health care settings; and the application of human rights to patient care.",
            "Based on these principles, it is clear that finding a violation of the prohibition of discrimination in forced sterilization cases is critical in addressing the systemic nature of the practice, acknowledging the marginalization of specific groups and effectively ending forced sterilization through addressing the underlying purpose of the practice.",
            "If litigators, non-governmental organizations and judicial officers are mindful of these principles when dealing with cases of forced sterilization, it is likely that they will be better able to eradicate forced sterilization."

            "Introduction: Systematic reviews show that women living with HIV (WLHIV) have high unmet sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs due to barriers to access sexual and reproductive health services (SRHS).",
            "In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), as of 2016, there were nearly one million WLHIV, but the existing evidence of their SRH needs comes from a few individual studies.",
            "This systematic review provides an overview of these women's needs to help define new and/or adapt existing public health strategies to the local context.",
            "This review synthesizes the evidence from the literature on the use of and access to SRHS related to family planning, antenatal care, abortion services and violence against WLHIV in LAC.",
            "Methods: Using a systematic review of mixed studies, a search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, INASP, POPLINE, SCOPUS, for studies conducted in LAC, from 2004 to 2017, as well as contact with authors and hand search as needed.",
            "Two independent reviewers evaluated the quality of the studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool; inclusion was conducted according to the PRISMA flow diagram.",

            "Results: A total of 18 studies in 13 LAC countries for a population of 5672 WLHIV were included.",
            "Data from individual studies reported unmet family planning needs; higher, but inconsistent use of condom as the sole contraceptive method OR=1.46 [1.26 to 1.69]; lesser use of other non-permanent contraceptive methods OR=0.26 [0.22 to 0.31]; more unplanned pregnancies OR=1.30 [1.02 to 1.66]; more induced abortions OR=1.96 [1.60 to 2.39]; higher risk of immediate postpartum sterilization; and higher exposure to sexual and institutional violence by WLHIV when compared with women without HIV.",
            "Conclusions: This review presents evidence from LAC about the SRH unmet needs of WLHIV that must be addressed by decreasing institutional and structural barriers, facilitating services and reducing stigma, and discrimination among healthcare providers to improve access to SRHS based on human rights, so women independently of their HIV status can make their own reproductive decisions, free of violence and coercion."

            "This study combined two data sets (free- text comments from a survey and qualitative interviews) to explore the range of experiences and perceptions of participation in Athena SWAN in medical science departments of a research-intensive university in Oxford, United Kingdom.",
            "Methods: The study is based on the secondary analysis of data from two projects: 59 respondents to an anonymous online survey (42 women, 17 men) provided relevant free-text comments and, separately, 37 women participated in face-to-face narrative interviews.",
            "Free-text survey comments and narrative interviews were analysed thematically using constant comparison.",

            "Many said that these positive changes would not have happened without linkage of Athena SWAN to government research funding, while others thought there were unintended consequences.",
            "Concerns about the programme design and implementation included a perception that Athena SWAN has limited ability to address longstanding and entrenched power and pay imbalances, persisting lack of work-life balance in academic medicine, questions about the sustainability of positive changes, belief that achieving the award could become an end in itself, resentment about perceived positive discrimination, and perceptions that further structural and cultural changes were needed in the university and wider society.",

            "The paper adopts Amartya Sen\u2019s women agency conceptual framework to advance the thesis of this article that while there is general consensus on achieving gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, the MDGs adopted in 2001 fell far short of fulfilling this consensus and that the incoming SDGs must respond to fundamental issues of GEWE from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.",

            "Analysis in the paper reveals that qualitative indicators such as human rights, equity, and capabilities were silent in the MDG design, constructs, and implementation.",

            "The aim of this study was threefold: to describe the landscape of gender-transformative programmes that attempt to influence health-related outcomes; to identify mechanisms through which successful programmes work; and to highlight where gaps might exist in implementation and evaluation.",

            "Interviews with nine female judoka (judo athletes) were gathered in Finland and analyzed using Foucauldian Discourse Analysis (FDA).",
            "The FDA revealed that in female judoka talk, judo was constructed as a sport for all, but also as a male domain and a manly sport with fighting and competition as innate masculine qualities that are not learned.",

            "Although this might be an empowering identity for female judoka, it does not advance the agenda of gender equity in martial arts because it constructs \u201cordinary\u201d women as biologically incapable of competitive judo.",
            "Our findings reveal that even in the relatively egalitarian culture of Finland, gender hierarchies persist in judo and that it is only by disrupting prevalent constructions of fighting and competitiveness as masculine that progress toward gender equity can be made."

            "As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be negatively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (social role hypothesis).",
            "On the other hand, greater availability of material and social resources removes the gender-neutral goal of subsistence, which creates the scope for gender-specific ambitions and desires.",
            "In addition, more gender-equal access to those resources may allow women and men to express preferences independently from each other.",
            "As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be positively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (resource hypothesis).",
            "We tested these competing predictions using data on experimentally validated measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples.",
            "So that the data would be geographically representative, the dataset was chosen so as to include all continents and a broad range of cultures and economic development levels.",
            "In total, the data represent about 90% of both the world population and global income.",
            "RESULTS",
            "The data revealed substantial cross-country variation in gender differences in preferences.",
            "Gender differences were found to be strongly positively associated with economic development as well as gender equality.",
            "These relationships held for each preference separately as well as for a summary index of differences in all preferences jointly.",
            "Quantitatively, this summary index exhibited correlations of 0.67 (P < 0.0001) with log GDP per capita and 0.56 (P < 0.0001) with a Gender Equality Index (a joint measure of four indices of gender equality), respectively.",
            "To isolate the separate impacts of economic development and gender equality, we conducted a conditional analysis, finding a quantitatively large and statistically significant association between gender differences and log GDP per capita conditional on the Gender Equality Index, and vice versa.",
            "These findings remained robust in several validation tests, such as accounting for potential culture-specific survey response behavior, aggregation bias, and nonlinear relationships.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "The reported evidence indicates that higher levels of economic development and gender equality favor the manifestation of gender differences in preferences across countries.",
            "Our results highlight the critical role of availability of material and social resources, as well as gender-equal access to these resources, in facilitating the independent formation and expression of gender-specific preferences."

            "Life expectancy (LE) at birth reflects the overall mortality level of a population.",
            "It summarizes the mortality patterns and health outcomes of various population groups such as women and men.",
            "Thus, LE can indicate health inequalities in the population.",
            "Even in the European Union (EU) with common goals and values and a common economic area, LE still differs between countries, and varies along sociodemographic variables.",
            "To reduce inequalities is a matter of fairness and as such should be of public interest.",
            "This paper puts gender inequalities in the focus.",
            "In EU 28 Member States LE at birth reached 83.3 years (women) and 77.9 years (men) on average in 2015.1 The gender gap in life expectancy (GGLE) at birth has narrowed from 6.4 years (2002) to 5.4 years (2015) on EU average but the size of this gender gap still varies substantially in Europe.1 As biological differences appear to play a minor role in explaining the GGLE,2,3 differences in social relationships or health-risk behaviour gain attention.4,5",
            "Men benefit more than women from the expansion of LE.",
            "For example, in the Netherlands, male LE increased between 1990 and 2015 by 8%, female LE by 4%.",
            "In other EU countries a comparable trend can be observed.",
            "As possible theoretical explanations for this trend, diminishment of gender inequality,3 role expansion theory (undertaking of different social roles such as paid work, child care and household activities),3 or convergence in unhealthy behaviours (reduction of risk behaviour in men, adoption of risk behaviour in women or both) are discussed.4 Social relationships and health-risk behaviour are shaped by social norms but studies on the influence of societal factors on LE are rare.6 Gender inequality, i.e.",
            "unequal distribution of wealth, power and benefits among women and men, is one of the most important societal factors.",
            "Gender inequality is socially determined and as such it is open to change by gender equality policies.7 Some studies have shown an association between gender inequality and health indicators on a national or international level.",
            "Gender inequality is associated with child and infant mortality8,9 as well as with men\u2019s health.3 Our paper addresses the question of whether gender inequality is also interrelated with the GGLE as well as to LE in both genders.",
            "The rationale is that gender differences in health related behaviours contribute to the gender gap in mortality and thus to LE, as behaviour is influenced by gender norms.",
            "We hypothesize that the GGLE is smaller in countries with more gender equality.",
            "With our analysis we want to contribute to the debate on reducing health inequalities between women and men.",
            "Methods",
            "We conducted an ecological study to investigate the association between gender inequality and (gender gap in) LE at birth in EU 28 Member States.",
            "To assess gender inequality we used the gender inequality index (GII) produced by the United Nations Development Programme with data from 2015 being the most recent available.",
            "The GII measures loss of human development in three dimensions with five indicators: reproductive health (maternal mortality ratio, adolescent birth rate), political empowerment (share of parliamentary seats held by each sex, attainment at secondary and higher education levels) and economic status (labour market participation rate).",
            "It ranges from 0, where women and men score equally, to 1, where one gender scores as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions.10 We calculated the GGLE (2015) by subtracting the LE of men from that of women.",
            "Using GII scores and GGLE data we computed Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient and created a scatter plot.",
            "Results",
            "In EU 28 Member States, on average the GGLE is 5.4 years in 2015.",
            "The range is 3.3 years (Netherlands) to 10.5 years (Lithuania).",
            "In 2015 the GII varies for EU 28 member states between 0.041 (Denmark) and 0.339 (Romania).",
            "Figure 1 shows the association between GGLE and GII.",
            "There is a positive weak correlation between the magnitude of GGLE and higher GII values (r2 = 0.180).",
            "Analysing the correlation of female resp.",
            "male LE with GII separately, shows even a stronger, moderate correlation coefficient of 0.418 (women) and 0.430 (men) (see Appendix).",
            "Conclusions",
            "The results show a positive, although weak correlation between GGLE and GII in the expected direction: the lower the gender inequality on a national level the smaller the GGLE.",
            "Gender inequality is not only associated with the GGLE but also with the LE itself.",
            "The correlation is even stronger than the association between GGLE and GII.",
            "Both results indicate that gender inequality is related to the health of women and men.",
            "The fact that in men a moderate correlation between LE and GII can also be observed, proves a positive association between gender equality and men\u2019s health.",
            "It could be cautiously interpreted that convergence of behaviours as well as expansion of roles as consequences of increasing gender equality might influence the LE of women and men.",
            "The limitation of the study is that the health dimension \u2018maternal mortality ratio\u2019 is part of the GII.",
            "The maternal mortality ratio itself affects the LE of women in the direction that higher maternal mortality ratios lead to lower life expectancies for women and thus to a reduction of the GGLE.",
            "However, the maternal mortality ratio is rather low in EU 28 Member States and differs between three deaths per 100 000 live births (Finland, Greece and Poland) and 31 death per 100 000 live births (Romania).",
            "Therefore, the influence on LE seems limited.",
            "Our results show that gender inequality affects LE in men and women as well as the GGLE.",

            "Key points",
            "The GGLE varies substantially in Europe.",
            "LE in men and women and gender equality are correlated: the higher the gender equality, the higher the LE in both sexes.",

            "Married women's ability to negotiate for safer sex is important for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya.",
            "Yet, its relationship to female genital mutilation is rarely explored, although female genital mutilation has been described as a social norm and marker of womanhood that can control women's sexuality.",

            "OBJECTIVES",
            "Few prospective studies have evaluated sexual function in women with female genital mutilation by cutting (FGM/C) before and after clitoral reconstructive surgery, and none used a validated questionnaire.",
            "A validated questionnaire, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used for the first time, to assess the impact of reconstructive surgery on sexual function in women with female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) before and after clitoral reconstructive surgery.",
            "STUDY DESIGN",
            "Women with FGM/C consulting at the Nantes University Hospital for clitoral reconstruction between 2013 and 2014 were prospectively included.",
            "All patients completed a questionnaire at inclusion, describing their social, demographic, and FGM/C characteristics.",
            "They were also asked to complete the FSFI as well as a questionnaire about clitoral sensations, symptoms of depression or anxiety, and self-esteem before and 3 and 6 months after the surgery.",
            "Paired Wilcoxon and McNemar tests were used to compare data.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Of the 12 women included, 9 (75%) had type II mutilations.",
            "Results showed a global sexual dysfunction (median FSFI summary score=17) before surgery.",
            "Clitoral sensations were absent in 8 women (67%).",
            "Six months after surgery, all FSFI dimensions except lubrication had improved significantly (median FSFI summary score=29, P=0.009).",
            "Ten women had clitoral sensations, and 11 (92%) were satisfied with their surgery.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "This study shows that 6 months after clitoral reconstructive surgery, women reported a multidimensional positive improvement in their sexual function.",
            "The FSFI is a promising tool for routine standardized assessment of the sexual function of women with FGM/C for determining appropriate management and assessing it.",
            "Larger studies with validated questionnaires assessing self-esteem, depression, and body image are also needed to develop an integrative approach and to provide evidence-based recommendations about management of these women."

            "In many countries where FGM/C is traditionally practiced, the prevalence rates of medicalization are increasing, and in countries of migration, such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America or Sweden, court cases or the repeated issuing of statements in favor of presumed minimal forms of FGM/C to replace more invasive forms, has raised the debate between the medical harm reduction arguments and the human rights approach.",
            "Main body: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the arguments associated with the medicalization of FGM/C, a trend that could undermine the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 5.3.",
            "The paper uses four country case studies, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya and UK, to discuss the reasons for engaging in medicalized forms of FGM/C, or not, and explores the ongoing public discourse in those countries concerning harm reduction versus human rights, and the contradiction between medical ethics, national criminal justice systems and international conventions.",
            "The discussion is structured around four key hotly contested ethical dilemmas.",
            "Firstly, that the WHO definition of medicalized FGM/C is too narrow allowing medicalized FGM to be justified by many healthcare professionals as a form of harm reduction which contradicts the medical oath of do no harm.",
            "Secondly, that medicalized FGM/C is a human rights abuse with lifelong consequences, no matter who performs it.",
            "Thirdly, that health care professionals who perform medicalized FGM/C are sustaining cultural norms that they themselves support and are also gaining financially.",
            "Fourthly, the contradiction between protecting traditional cultural rights in legal constitutions versus human rights legislation, which criminalizes FGM/C.",
            "Conclusion: More research needs to be done in order to understand the complexities that are facilitating the medicalization of FGM/C as well as how policy strategies can be strengthened to have a greater de-medicalization impact.",
