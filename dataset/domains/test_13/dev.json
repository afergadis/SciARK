            "The authors examined a cohort of faculty from the 1995 National Faculty Survey to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty.",
            "Method: The authors followed 1,273 faculty at 24 medical schools in the continental United States for 17 years to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty.",
            "Schools were balanced for public or private status and the four Association of American Medical Colleges geographic regions.",
            "The authors used regression models to adjust for covariates: seniority, department, academic setting, and race/ethnicity.",
            "Results: After adjusting for significant covariates, women were less likely than men to achieve the rank of professor (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78) or to remain in academic careers (OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94).",
            "When number of refereed publications was added to the model, differences by gender in retention and attainment of senior rank were no longer significant.",
            "Male faculty were more likely to hold senior leadership positions after adjusting for publications (OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69).",
            "Conclusions: Gender disparities in rank, retention, and leadership remain across the career trajectories of the faculty cohort in this study.",
            "Women were less likely to attain senior-level positions than men, even after adjusting for publication-related productivity.",

            "Objectives",
            "To quantitatively assess the relationships of childhood experiences of marriage, pregnancy, and sexual violence with underage sex trafficking.",
            "Methods",
            "Cross-sectional survey data from a population-based sample of 603 female sex workers from Tijuana and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, were collected in 2013 and 2014, and we analyzed the data to evaluate relationships between pregnancy, marriage, and sexual violence when younger than 16 years, and child sex trafficking.",
            "Results",
            "Adjusted odds of child sex trafficking among those who experienced pregnancy, marriage, and childhood sexual violence when younger than 16 years in combined models were 2.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.8, 4.3), 1.7 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.99, 2.8), and 1.7 (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01, 3.0), respectively, relative to others (n\u2009=\u2009603).",
            "For 89.8%, 78.0%, and 97.0% of those who had an experience of pregnancy (n\u2009=\u200969), marriage (n\u2009=\u200950), or sexual violence (n\u2009=\u200933) when younger than 16 years, respectively, the experience occurred before or the same year as sex trafficking.",
            "Conclusions",
            "These results provide empirical evidence of modifiable risk factors for child sex trafficking that could be integrated into the prevention efforts and protocols of health clinics and governmental agencies in Mexico currently working to reduce underage pregnancy, marriage, and sexual violence."

            "In Poland, every fourth death caused by external reasons is the result of a road traffic crash and Poland has one of the highest road fatality rates in relation to vehicle ownership in Europe, with an average 23 deaths per million residents.",
            "This rate is two times higher than most other European Union countries.",
            "Materials and methods: The research is based on a secondary analysis of data contained in multiple Polish governmental reports, including those of the Prevention and Analysis Office of Road Traffic Headquarters of Police, National Road Safety Program-GAMBIT 2005, National Road Safety Program 2013 to 2020, and Strategy for Efficient State in 2020, plus previous publications describing road safety in Poland.",

            "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), target 3.1 requires participating countries to reduce their maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.",
            "Although much research has been conducted, knowing the spatial patterns and risk factors associated with maternal mortality in developing countries helps target scarce resources and intervention programmes to high risk areas for the greatest impact.",
            "Methods:                    Data were analysed from a longitudinal open cohort of women aged 15 to 49 years, enrolled from 2006 to 2010.",
            "An inverse distance weighted method of interpolation was used to assess spatial patterns of maternal mortality.",
            "Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with maternal mortality.",
            "Results:                    The overall maternal mortality rate for the 36 792 study participants for the five years was 0.79 per 1000 person years.",
            "The trend declined from 90.42 in 2006 to 57.42 in 2010.",
            "Marked geographical differences were observed in maternal mortality patterns.",
            "The main causes of maternal death were eclampsia (23%), haemorrhage (22%) and abortion-related complications (10%).",
            "There was a reduced risk of 82% (HR = 0.18, 95% CI:0.05-0.74) and 78% (HR = 0.22, 95% CI:0.05-0.92) for women aged 20-29 and 30-39 years, respectively, compared with those younger than 20 years.",
            "While being married had a protective effect of 94% (HR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01-0.51) compared with being single, women who were widowed had an increased risk of maternal death of 913% (HR = 9.13, 95% CI: 1.02-81.94).",
            "Women who belong to poorer, poor and least poor socioeconomic quintile had 84%, 71% and 72% reduction in risk of maternal mortality respectively compared to those in the poorest category (HR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.06-0.42; HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12-0.69; HR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.10-0.80).",
            "Conclusion:                    Maternal mortality has declined in rural southern Tanzania since 2006, with geographical differences in patterns of death.",
            "Eclampsia, haemorrhage and abortion-related complications are the three leading causes of maternal death in the region, with risk factors being younger than 20 years, being single or widowed, and having a low socioeconomic status."

            "Methods: The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) was used to estimate reductions in all-cause child mortality due to changes in coverage of treatment for the integrated community case management (iCCM) illnesses - malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea - while accounting for other changes in maternal and child health interventions in each RAcE project area.",
            "Data from RAcE baseline and endline household surveys, Demographic and Health Surveys, and routine health service data were used in each LiST model.",

            "Results: The LiST model accounts for coverage changes in iCCM intervention coverage and other health trends in each project area to estimate mortality reduction and child lives saved.",
            "Under five mortality declined in all six RAcE sites, with an average decline of 10 percent.",
            "An estimated 6200 under-five lives were saved by malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea treatment in the DRC, Malawi, Niger, and Nigeria, of which approximately 4940 (75 percent) were saved by treatment provided by CHWs.",
            "This total excludes Mozambique, where there were no estimated under-five lives saved likely due to widespread stockouts of key medications.",
            "In all other project areas, lives saved by CHW-provided treatment contributed substantially to the estimated decline in under-five mortality.",
            "Conclusions: Our results suggest that iCCM is a strategy that can save lives and measurably decrease child mortality in settings where access to health facility services is low and adequate resources for iCCM implementation are provided for CHW services."

            "This paper explains some adverse effects due to a massive injection of renewables when electricity storage is not available, such as a fall of electricity prices on the spot market or a crowding-out effect for nuclear power stations due to the merit order logic.",
            "From the French experience, it presents a model that calculates the additional cost of electricity production when the share of nuclear generation is reduced to 50% instead of 72% today and when, in compensation, renewable energy (wind and solar) is stored either by batteries or by power-to-gas.",
            "The simulations minimize the cost of the energy mix by optimizing the electricity storage mix: batteries (daily storage) and Power-to-Gas/Gas-to-Power (seasonal storage).",
