            "Abstract",
            "Purpose: Prior studies have found that women in academic medicine do not advance or remain in their careers in parity with men.",
            "The authors examined a cohort of faculty from the 1995 National Faculty Survey to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty.",
            "Method: The authors followed 1,273 faculty at 24 medical schools in the continental United States for 17 years to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty.",
            "Schools were balanced for public or private status and the four Association of American Medical Colleges geographic regions.",
            "The authors used regression models to adjust for covariates: seniority, department, academic setting, and race/ethnicity.",
            "Results: After adjusting for significant covariates, women were less likely than men to achieve the rank of professor (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78) or to remain in academic careers (OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94).",
            "When number of refereed publications was added to the model, differences by gender in retention and attainment of senior rank were no longer significant.",
            "Male faculty were more likely to hold senior leadership positions after adjusting for publications (OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69).",
            "Conclusions: Gender disparities in rank, retention, and leadership remain across the career trajectories of the faculty cohort in this study.",
            "Women were less likely to attain senior-level positions than men, even after adjusting for publication-related productivity.",
            "Institutions must examine the climate for women to ensure their academic capital is fully utilized and equal opportunity exists for leadership."

            "So far, however, this potential environmental benefit of waste-fed insects is unknown.",
            "This study, therefore, explores the environmental impact of using larvae of the common housefly grown on poultry manure and food waste as livestock feed.",
            "Data were provided by a laboratory plant in the Netherlands aiming to design an industrial plant for rearing housefly larvae.",
            "Production of 1\u00a0ton dry matter of larvae meal directly resulted in a global warming potential of 770\u00a0kg CO2 equivalents, an energy use of 9329\u00a0MJ and a land use of 32\u00a0m2, caused by use of water, electricity, and feed for flies, eggs and larvae.",
            "Production of larvae meal, however, also has indirect environmental consequences.",
            "Food waste, for example, was originally used for production of bio-energy.",
            "Accounting for these indirect consequences implies, e.g., including the environmental impact of production of energy needed to replace the original bio-energy function of food waste.",
            "Assuming, furthermore, that 1\u00a0ton of larvae meal replaced 0.5\u00a0ton of fishmeal and 0.5\u00a0ton of soybean meal, the production of 1\u00a0ton larvae meal reduced land use (1713\u00a0m2), but increased energy use (21,342\u00a0MJ) and consequently global warming potential (1959\u00a0kg\u00a0CO2-eq).",
            "Results of this study will enhance a transparent societal and political debate about future options and limitations of larvae meal as livestock feed.",
            "Results of the indirect environmental impact, however, are situation specific, e.g.",
            "in this study food waste was used for anaerobic digestion.",
            "In case food waste would have been used for, e.g., composting, the energy use and related emission of greenhouse gases might decrease.",
            "Furthermore, the industrial process to acquire housefly larvae meal is still advancing, which also offers potential to reduce energy use and related emissions.",
            "Eventually, land scarcity will increase further, whereas opportunities exist to reduce energy use by, e.g., technical innovations or an increased use of solar or wind energy.",
            "Larvae meal production, therefore, has potential to reduce the environmental impact of the livestock sector."

            "Methods A questionnaire-based survey was conducted on non-Chengdu household workers over 16 years old in four directions(east,south,west,and north)of Chengdu from June 2017 to June 2018 to collect their social demographic characteristics and mental health status information through respondent driven sampling method.",
            "The 12-item general health questionnaire(GHQ-12) was used to assess the mental health status of the respondents,and a multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of mental health.",
            "Results The average score of GHQ-12 was (1.09\u00b11.61) and the detection rate of mental problems was 7.11%.",
            "The main mental problems were anxiety and nervousness.",
            "Multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that over 55 years old (OR=0.425, 95% CI=0.213-0.847), junior middle school education (OR=0.541, 95% CI=0.356-0.824), length of residence \u22655 years (5-9 years: OR=0.603, 95% CI=0.394-0.923; \u226510 years: OR=0.534, 95% CI=0.346-0.823), annual income \u226518 000 yuan (18 000-35 999 yuan: OR=0.524, 95% CI=0.328-0.836; 36 000-59 999 yuan: OR=0.327, 95% CI=0.190-0.565; \u226560 000 yuan: OR=0.356, 95% CI=0.192-0.662), and a good relationship with employers (OR=0.519, 95% CI=0.363-0.742) were the protective factors for the mental health.",

            "Conclusions The mental health of the floating population in Chengdu is generally good.",
            "However, floating individuals with poor marital status and/or poor sense of belonging to Chengdu are at higher risk of mental problems.",

            "METHOD",
            "Interviews were conducted with eight women from Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia.",
            "The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.",
            "RESULTS",
            "The women's feelings were ambivalent: though they opposed FGM, on the one hand, because of its negative effects on health, they acknowledged the practice's positive cultural aspects on the other hand.",
            "The themes that emerged from the interviews are the role of FGM in ensuring virginity and protecting a family's honor, its role in avoiding shame and enhancing purity, social pressure experienced after immigration, an understanding of FGM as a symbol of the country of origin, and support for changing the tradition.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "These findings indicate that women originating from communities where FGM is normative live in a context in which the practice is viewed as an important aspect of life even after immigration.",
            "More research concerning this complex and deeply rooted cultural issue is recommended."

            "Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was based on data from the Health, Well-Being, and Aging survey (Salud, Bienestar y Envejecimiento, or \"SABE survey\"), which was carried out in 1999 and 2000 in Bridgetown, Barbados; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Havana, Cuba; Mexico City, Mexico; Montevideo, Uruguay; Santiago, Chile; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.",
            "The survey looked at the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the participants, several health indicators (self-reported chronic diseases, depression, and cognitive features), the social and family support network, the use of health services, reported and observed functionality, the respondent's income, and the durable consumer goods in the household.",
            "In probit regression models, self-reported fair or poor health was used as the dependent variable.",
            "The marginal effect of each categorical explanatory variable was used to indicate the difference between the probability of reporting poor health by persons who did or did not have a given characteristic.",
            "Results: In all the cities studied the self-reporting of \"excellent\" health was very low (6% or less).",
            "The results of the multivariate analysis of the relationships between SRGH and covariates showed: (1) the relative importance of several health indicators as covariates of SRGH, (2) the association between sociodemographic characteristics and SRGH, and (3) the differences or similarities found among the seven cities with respect to the relationships studied.",
            "The level of self-rated good health was highest in Buenos Aires and Montevideo (60%), followed by Bridgetown and S\u00e3o Paulo (around 50%) and Havana, Santiago, and Mexico City (between 30% and 40%).",
            "The respondents' evaluation of their memory was the factor that was most strongly related to SRGH, followed by satisfaction with nutritional status and satisfaction with life.",
            "Conclusions: The SRGH captured multiple facets of the health of the older adults, such as suffering from chronic diseases, the degree of satisfaction with the level of nutrition and with life, perception of memory, and any functional problems.",
            "More detailed studies should be undertaken to try to determine the role that the emotional health of older adults in Latin America and the Caribbean plays in the demand for health care, and to determine if there is some association between SRGH and the use of health services."

            "Abstract: The response of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise during the twenty-first century remains uncertain.",
            "Global-scale projections suggest that between 20 and 90 per cent (for low and high sea-level rise scenarios, respectively) of the present-day coastal wetland area will be lost, which will in turn result in the loss of biodiversity and highly valued ecosystem services.",
            "These projections do not necessarily take into account all essential geomorphological and socio-economic system feedbacks8.",
            "Here we present an integrated global modelling approach that considers both the ability of coastal wetlands to build up vertically by sediment accretion, and the accommodation space, namely, the vertical and lateral space available for fine sediments to accumulate and be colonized by wetland vegetation.",
            "We use this approach to assess global-scale changes in coastal wetland area in response to global sea-level rise and anthropogenic coastal occupation during the twenty-first century.",
            "On the basis of our simulations, we find that, globally, rather than losses, wetland gains of up to 60 per cent of the current area are possible, if more than 37 per cent (our upper estimate for current accommodation space) of coastal wetlands have sufficient accommodation space, and sediment supply remains at present levels.",
            "In contrast to previous studies, we project that until 2100, the loss of global coastal wetland area will range between 0 and 30 per cent, assuming no further accommodation space in addition to current levels.",
            "Our simulations suggest that the resilience of global wetlands is primarily driven by the availability of accommodation space, which is strongly influenced by the building of anthropogenic infrastructure in the coastal zone and such infrastructure is expected to change over the twenty-first century.",
            "Rather than being an inevitable consequence of global sea-level rise, our findings indicate that large-scale loss of coastal wetlands might be avoidable, if sufficient additional accommodation space can be created through careful nature-based adaptation solutions to coastal management."

            "This study aimed to characterize the trends in suicide mortality in Japan by method since 1979.",
            "Using data from the Japan vital registration system, we calculated age-standardized rates of suicide mortality separately by sex and method.",
            "We conducted a log-linear regression of suicide mortality rates separately by sex, and linear regression analysis of the proportion of deaths due to hanging, including a test for change in level and trend in 1998.",
            "While crude suicide rates were static over the time period, age-adjusted rates declined.",
            "The significant increase in suicide mortality in 1998 was primarily driven by large changes in the rate of hanging, with suicide deaths after 1998 having 36.7% higher odds of being due to hanging for men (95% CI: 16.3-60.8%), and 21.9% higher odds of being due to hanging for women (95% CI: 9.2-35.9%).",
            "Hanging has become an increasingly important method for committing suicide over the past 40 years, and although suicide rates have been declining continuously over this time, more effort is needed to prevent hanging and address the potential cultural drivers of suicide if the rate is to continue to decline in the future."

            "Abstract: The Mediterranean mountains have been subject to significant land abandonment process during the second half of the 20th century.",
            "The subsequent natural revegetation following abandonment in rural areas has been widely documented to have substantial implications on the hydrological cycle and the vegetation.",
            "The Spanish Pyrenees are one of the most affected areas by these land transformations which could threaten their importance for water supply and agricultural activities in the downstream lowland areas.",
            "Land managers as well as scientists around the world have taken different positions on how to deal with these land use changes.",
            "Some are in favor of active management (AM) (i.e.",
            "density reduction) while others are supporting passive management (PM) (letting the process of revegetation continue).",
            "This study aims to investigate the implication of AM and PM on hydrological and vegetation dynamics under different climate trajectories in a representative abandoned cropland catchment in the Central Spanish Pyrenees.",
            "A coupled ecohydrologic model is used to estimate the post management response of streamflow (STR), evapotranspiration (ET), soil saturation deficit (SD) and plant carbon (PC) following shrub clearing.",
            "Clearing increased annual STR by 16%, while ET and SD decreased by around \u22129% and \u22126% respectively during the first year after management with changes to monthly flows.",
            "These changes to water regimes may be even higher in wetter years.",
            "Over a 10-years period of vegetation recovery annual STR increased between 7.1% and 24.2%, while annual ET and SD decreased between \u22122.6% to \u22128.7% and \u22122.7% to \u22126% respectively due to shrub clearing, with the highest changes occurring in the first three years of AM.",
            "On the effect of climate change, our results show that a 2 \u00b0C increase in temperature could reduce AM effects on water regimes and accelerate the recovery of PC given averaged rainfall conditions."

            "The dynamic change characteristics and the impact of social and economic influencing factors on the nitrogen footprint were analyzed.",
            "Our results revealed that from 2000 to 2015, the total N footprint in the Min River Basin increased from 173,609 Mg to 275,803 Mg, with an increase from 20.3\u202fkg N/capita/yr to 26.0\u202fkg N/capita/yr.",
            "The increase in the N footprint was mainly due to high urbanization, and the per capita food N footprint changes in rural and urban areas were positively correlated with changes in food consumption patterns.",
            "The nitrogen footprint of the urban residents increased at a stable average rate of 18.0\u202fkg N/capita/yr, but the nitrogen footprint of rural residents initially decreased and then increased, eventually reaching an average value of 16.9\u202fkg N/capita/yr.",
            "These data revealed the gradual narrowing of the rural-urban gap of the nitrogen footprint.",
            "Foods with a high-nitrogen content accounted for a high proportion (61%) of the per capita nitrogen footprint of the urban residents, whereas the proportion of the high-nitrogen foods (e.g., animal meat and aquatic products) of the rural residents increased from 39% to 57% over the time period of the study.",
            "In addition, the analysis of the correlation between food nitrogen footprint and social and economic factors showed that the nitrogen footprint was influenced by income and consumption levels, family size, education degree, and regional dietary habits.",
            "The food nitrogen footprints of the urban and rural residents in the basin were positively correlated with per capita disposable income and resident consumption level but negatively correlated with the Engel\u2019s coefficient and the average family size.",
            "Our results provide evidence that basin residents can effectively reduce their N footprint by increasing nitrogen utilization in food production, optimizing their dietary structure, maintaining reasonable low nitrogen dietary habits, and using clean energy sources."
