            "Despite widespread global efforts to promote clean cookstoves to achieve improvements in air and forest quality, and to reduce global climate change, surprisingly little is known about the degree to which these actually reduce biomass fuel consumption in real-world settings.",
            "Using data from in-house weighing of fuel conducted in rural India, we examine the impact of cleaner cookstoves \u2fff most of which are LPG stoves \u2fff on three key outcomes related to solid fuel use.",

            "These findings of substantial savings are robust to the use of estimators with varying levels of control for selection, and to alternative data obtained from household self-reports.",
            "Our results support the idea that efforts to promote clean stoves among poor rural households can reduce solid fuel use and cooking time, and that rebound effects toward greater amounts of cooking on multiple stoves are not sufficient to eliminate these gains.",
            "We also find, however, that households who have greater wealth, fewer members, are in less marginalized groups, and practice other health-averting behaviors, are more likely to use these cleaner stoves, which suggests that socio-economic status plays an important role in determining who benefits from such technologies.",
            "Future efforts to capture social benefits must therefore consider how to promote the use of alternative technologies by poor households, given that these households are least likely to own clean stoves."

            "We assessed the relationship between cooking practices and ALRI in pooled datasets of Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2000 and 2011 in countries of sub-Saharan Africa.",

            "Main cooking fuel had a statistically significant impact on ALRI risk (p<0.0001), with season acting as an effect modifier (p = 0.034).",
            "During the rainy season, relative to clean fuels, the odds of suffering from ALRI were raised for kerosene (OR 1.64; CI: 0.99, 2.71), coal and charcoal (OR 1.54; CI: 1.21, 1.97), wood (OR 1.20; CI: 0.95, 1.51) and lower-grade biomass fuels (OR 1.49; CI: 0.93, 2.35).",

            "The transition to cleaner energy sources has seen a much higher penetration of renewable sources of electricity on the grid than ever before.",
            "Among these renewable generation sources are wind and solar power which provide intermittent and often unpredictable energy generation throughout the day depending on weather conditions.",
            "The connection of such renewable sources poses problems for electricity network operators whose legacy systems have been designed to use traditional generation sources where supply can be increased as required to meet demand.",
            "Among the solutions proposed to address this issue with intermittency in generation are storage systems and automation systems which aim to reduce demand in order to match the available renewable generation.",

            "The package also provides a flexible framework that allows system components to be developed in full object-orientated programming languages at run time, rather than having to use additional third-party development environments.",
            "As well as describing the background to the work and the design of the new software, this thesis describes validation studies that were carried out to verify the accuracy of the results produced by the package.",
            "A simulation-based case study was also carried out to demonstrate the features offered by the new platform in which a smart domestic energy control system including photovoltaic generation, hot water storage and battery storage was developed.",
            "During the development of this system, new algorithms for obtaining the operating point of solar panels and photovoltaic maximum power point tracking were developed."

            "The growing demand for renewable energy stimulates the exploration of new materials and methods for clean energy, a process which is boosted by nanoscience and emerging nanotechnologies.",
            "Recently a high efficiency and high power density energy conversion mechanism was demonstrated through the use of jetted charged microdroplets, which fully relies on the net charges stored in the electrical double layer within a hundred nanometers of the water/gas interface, and then delivered at a metal target for converting kinetic energy to electrical energy.",
            "The method is fundamentally different from the traditional electrokinetic conversion and electrostatic generators, termed as ballistic energy conversion.",
            "It has a great potential in further applications due to the ultra-simple device design and the use of water, avoiding the challenges of new materials inventions.However, thorough theory is still lacking for both a quantitative description and an optimization of this system.Here we model and experimentally characterize the physical properties of the ballistic energy conversion system.",
            "Our model predicts the optimal working conditions of the energy harvesting including initial velocity and jet size, as well as the key performance factors including efficiency, generated target voltage, and power density.",
            "The results show that by using maximally charged droplets, an appropriate size and initial velocity of microjet, the system efficiency can be over 90%, at a generated voltage below 1 kV and a power density of at least 100 W/m2.",
            "The combination of high efficiency, huge power density, simplicity and compactness makes the ballistic energy conversion generator a promising device for green energy conversion."
