            "Abstract",
            "Background",
            "In 2007, the Indonesian Government instigated a national program to convert domestic kerosene users to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking.",
            "This was primarily motivated by the rising cost of kerosene subsidies.",
            "Objective",
            "To review the national conversion program and LPG scale up by evaluating its impacts, including assessing sustained changes in cooking behaviour and consequent reductions in exposure to household air pollution (HAP).",
            "Methods and data sources",
            "Searches of peer-review and grey literature in both English and Bahasa Indonesian were conducted and supplemented by interviews with key informants, data from the National Statistics Agency and results from household surveys.",
            "The data were extracted and analyzed using an Implementation Science approach.",
            "Results",
            "The main kerosene to LPG conversion phase took place in highly populated kerosene dependent areas between 2007 and 2012 reaching over 50 million households, approximately two thirds of all households in Indonesia.",
            "Since then the drive to expand LPG use has continued at a slower pace, especially in more remote provinces where solid fuel is more widely used.",
            "Over 57 million LPG start up kits were distributed as of 2015.",
            "Beginning in 2018, the open subsidy for LPG is expected to be replaced by one targeted at lower income households.",
            "While the main conversion phase has been highlighted as an example of effective and impressively fast fuel switching at scale, the impact on domestic biomass use remains limited.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Addressing HAP and the health impacts associated with kerosene and biomass use was never an objective of the program.",
            "Consequently, there is limited evidence of impact in this area, and in hindsight, missed opportunities in terms of influencing cooking behaviour change among biomass users, who are more at risk."

            "However, limited research examines the full range of ways in which people, who live in highly gender-unequal societies, actually use traditional gender narratives to negotiate issues of women's empowerment and gender equality.",
            "Drawing on qualitative data collected from three rural South Sudanese communities\u2014comprising interviews and focus groups with 94 research participants, and over five hours of community radio content\u2014this study demonstrates that gender narratives considered to be traditional by the South Sudanese, during a post-conflict transition period, do not necessarily constitute barriers to the advancement of gender and development goals.",
            "Rather, the South Sudanese use traditional gender narratives, in this context, to both resist and support goals that the international development community prioritizes.",
            "By providing evidence that traditional gender narratives are mobilized and used by community members to support women's equality and empowerment, this paper challenges and extends development scholarship that positions traditional narratives as barriers, and encourages development practitioners to consider how they might critically harness, rather than reject, such narratives in the pursuit of gender and development goals."

            "As part of its Paris Agreement commitment, China pledged to peak carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions around 2030, striving to peak earlier, and to increase the non-fossil share of primary energy to 20% by 2030.",
            "Yet by the end of 2017, China emitted 28% of the world\u2019s energy-related CO2 emissions, 76% of which were from coal use.",
            "How China can reinvent its energy economy cost-effectively while still achieving its commitments was the focus of a three-year joint research project completed in September 2016.",
            "Overall, this analysis found that if China follows a pathway in which it aggressively adopts all cost-effective energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction technologies while also aggressively moving away from fossil fuels to renewable and other non-fossil resources, it is possible to not only meet its Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) commitments, but also to reduce its 2050 CO2 emissions to a level that is 42% below the country\u2019s 2010 CO2 emissions.",
            "While numerous barriers exist that will need to be addressed through effective policies and programs in order to realize these potential energy use and emissions reductions, there are also significant local environmental (e.g., air quality), national and global environmental (e.g., mitigation of climate change), human health, and other unquantified benefits that will be realized if this pathway is pursued in China."

            "In the margin soils, earthworm abundance was significantly greater in the frequently flooded areas (+140.56%), likely due to higher soil organic matter content and lower bulk density resulting in soil conditions more amenable to earthworms.",

            "The paper also asks farmers whether they perceive any barriers to adaptation and attempts to determine the characteristics of those farmers who, despite claiming to have witnessed climate change, have not yet responded to it.",

            "Background",
            "The causes of poor respiratory function and COPD are incompletely understood, but it is clear that genes and the environment play a role.",
            "As DNA methylation is under both genetic and environmental control, we hypothesised that investigation of differential methylation associated with these phenotypes would permit mechanistic insights, and improve prediction of COPD.",
            "We investigated genome-wide differential DNA methylation patterns using the recently released 850K Illumina EPIC array in the largest single population sample to date.",

            "Methods",
            "Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of respiratory function and COPD were performed in peripheral blood samples from the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) cohort (N=3,791; 274 COPD cases and 2,928 controls).",
            "In independent COPD incidence data (N=150), significantly differentially methylated sites (DMSs; p&lt;3.6\u00d710\u22128) were evaluated for their added predictive power when added to a model including clinical variables, age, sex, height and smoking history using receiver operating characteristic analysis.",
            "The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) was used to replicate association (N=895) and prediction (N=178) results.",
            "",
            "Findings",
            "We identified 29 respiratory function and/or COPD associated DMSs, which mapped to genes involved in alternative splicing, JAK-STAT signalling, and axon guidance.",
            "In prediction analyses, we observed significant improvement in discrimination between COPD cases and controls (p&lt;0.05) in independent GS:SFHS (p=0.014) and LBC1936 (p=0.018) datasets by adding DMSs to a clinical model.",

            "We found some evidence for association between differential DNA methylation and both respiratory function and COPD.",
            "Of the twelve previous studies identified, eight used peripheral blood samples (sample size [N] range = 100-1,085) and four used lung tissue samples (N range = 24-160).",
            "The number of CpG loci analysed range from 27,578 to 485,512.",
            "These studies have not identified consistent changes in methylation, most likely due to a combination of factors including small sample sizes, technical issues, phenotypic definitions, and study design.",
            "In addition, no previous study has: analysed a sample from a large single cohort; used the recently released Illumina EPIC array (which assesses ~850,000 CpG loci); adjusted methylation data and phenotype for smoking history, or used both prevalent and incident COPD electronic health record data.",
            "",
            "Added value of this study",
            "To our knowledge, this is the largest single cohort epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of respiratory function and COPD to date (N=3,791).",
            "After applying stringent genome-wide significance criteria (P &lt;3.6\u00d710\u22128), we found that DNA methylation levels at 29 CpG sites in peripheral blood were associated with respiratory function or COPD.",
            "Of these 29, seven were testable in an independent population sample: all seven showed consistent direction of effect between the two samples and three showed replication (p&lt;0.007 [0.05/7 CpG sites tested]).",
            "Our results suggest that adjustment of both the phenotypic and the DNA methylation probe data for smoking history, which has not been carried out in previous studies, reduces the confounding effects of smoking, identifies larger numbers of associations, and reduces the heterogeneity of effects across smoking strata.",
            "We used gene set enrichment and pathway analyses, together with an approach that combines DNA methylation results with gene expression data to provide evidence for enrichment of differentially methylated sites in genes linked to alternative splicing, and JAK-STAT signalling and axon guidance.",
            "Finally, we demonstrated that the inclusion of DNA methylation data improves COPD risk prediction over established clinical variables alone in two independent datasets.",
            "",
            "Implications of all the available evidence",
            "There is now accumulating evidence that DNA methylation in peripheral blood is associated with respiratory function and COPD.",
            "Our study has shown that DNA methylation levels at 29 CpG sites are robustly associated with respiratory function and COPD, provide mechanistic insights, and can improve prediction of COPD risk.",
            "Further studies are warranted to improve understanding of the aetiology of COPD and to assess the utility of DNA methylation profiling in the clinical management of this condition."
