            "Abstract",
            "The main objective of this study is to determine the factors affecting households\u2019 fuel type choices for space heating; this is accomplished using both ordered and unordered discrete choice models utilising the data of 93,119 households.",
            "The data are drawn from Turkish Statistical Institute Household Budget Surveys (THBS) between 2003 and 2011 under three distinctive scenarios.",
            "The results reveal that there is a statistically significant and strong relationship between households\u2019 fuel type choices for space heating and household head's gender, occupation group, household income, household size, type of dwelling, type of space heating system, dwelling size, number of rooms in the dwelling, settlement and region.",
            "The empirical evidence indicates that households still rely on traditional fuel types, especially in the rural areas of Turkey.",
            "For the model comparison, the ordered response models outperform the unordered response models in one of the three scenarios.",
            "Thus, we suggest that ordered response models can also be performed to estimate households\u2019 fuel type choice behaviour.",
            "As far as we know, this is the first attempt that simultaneously compares both ordered and unordered choice models using a Turkish sample.",
            "The empirical evidence can help shed light on Turkish households\u2019 fuel stacking behaviour for future energy policies."

            "However, the environment \u2013 and especially climate change \u2013 is hyper-polarized amongst the American public, and non-environmental justifications for renewable energy may resonate more broadly.",
            "Using a 2016 mail survey of individuals living in five states in the Rocky Mountain region of the U.S., we examine predictors of public approval of renewable energy usage, approval of a 20% renewable portfolio standard policy, and agreement with seven frames for renewable energy, of which four referenced the environment and three did not.",
            "We build upon previous research by analyzing geographic variation in frame agreement and by testing a religious environmental stewardship and resource-conservation frame.",
            "Results indicate high approval renewable energy but mixed support for the policy measure.",
            "Respondents on average agreed with all seven renewable energy frames, with energy security and energy diversification receiving the most support.",
            "Of the four environmental frames, air pollution and resource conservation had the most support, and the religion and climate frames had the least.",
            "We note variation by state, particularly on support for the policy measure.",
            "Political ideology and belief in human-caused global warming were consistent predictors, though gender, residence in a metro county, neoliberal ideology, and state of residence were also important.",
            "Overall, our results echo other research indicating that non-climate-based frames for renewable energy are likely to garner broader public support, but we suggest that the significance of this finding is particularly important in certain political and geographical contexts."

            "The causes of poor respiratory function and COPD are incompletely understood, but it is clear that genes and the environment play a role.",

            "These studies have not identified consistent changes in methylation, most likely due to a combination of factors including small sample sizes, technical issues, phenotypic definitions, and study design.",

            "To our knowledge, this is the largest single cohort epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of respiratory function and COPD to date (N=3,791).",
            "After applying stringent genome-wide significance criteria (P &lt;3.6\u00d710\u22128), we found that DNA methylation levels at 29 CpG sites in peripheral blood were associated with respiratory function or COPD.",
            "Of these 29, seven were testable in an independent population sample: all seven showed consistent direction of effect between the two samples and three showed replication (p&lt;0.007 [0.05/7 CpG sites tested]).",
            "Our results suggest that adjustment of both the phenotypic and the DNA methylation probe data for smoking history, which has not been carried out in previous studies, reduces the confounding effects of smoking, identifies larger numbers of associations, and reduces the heterogeneity of effects across smoking strata.",
            "We used gene set enrichment and pathway analyses, together with an approach that combines DNA methylation results with gene expression data to provide evidence for enrichment of differentially methylated sites in genes linked to alternative splicing, and JAK-STAT signalling and axon guidance.",
            "Finally, we demonstrated that the inclusion of DNA methylation data improves COPD risk prediction over established clinical variables alone in two independent datasets.",
            "",
            "Implications of all the available evidence",
            "There is now accumulating evidence that DNA methylation in peripheral blood is associated with respiratory function and COPD.",
            "Our study has shown that DNA methylation levels at 29 CpG sites are robustly associated with respiratory function and COPD, provide mechanistic insights, and can improve prediction of COPD risk.",

            "Although the health care system is an important site for identification and intervention, there have been challenges in determining how health care professionals can best address this issue in practice.",
            "We surveyed nurses and physicians in 2004 regarding their attitudes and behaviours with respect to IPV, including whether they routinely inquire about IPV, as well as potentially relevant barriers, facilitators, experiential, and practice-related factors.",
            "Methods",
            "A modified Dillman Tailored Design approach was used to survey 1000 nurses and 1000 physicians by mail in Ontario, Canada.",
            "Respondents were randomly selected from professional directories and represented practice areas pre-identified from the literature as those most likely to care for women at the point of initial IPV disclosure: family practice, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency care, maternal/newborn care, and public health.",

            "Methods: The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) was used to estimate reductions in all-cause child mortality due to changes in coverage of treatment for the integrated community case management (iCCM) illnesses - malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea - while accounting for other changes in maternal and child health interventions in each RAcE project area.",
            "Data from RAcE baseline and endline household surveys, Demographic and Health Surveys, and routine health service data were used in each LiST model.",

            "Results: The LiST model accounts for coverage changes in iCCM intervention coverage and other health trends in each project area to estimate mortality reduction and child lives saved.",
            "Under five mortality declined in all six RAcE sites, with an average decline of 10 percent.",
            "An estimated 6200 under-five lives were saved by malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea treatment in the DRC, Malawi, Niger, and Nigeria, of which approximately 4940 (75 percent) were saved by treatment provided by CHWs.",
            "This total excludes Mozambique, where there were no estimated under-five lives saved likely due to widespread stockouts of key medications.",

            "Data from 39 semi-structured interviews with rural and urban type II diabetes patients and a mix of rural health care providers were analysed to develop a theoretical understanding of the social processes that define diabetes management in that context.",

            "\ufeffThe association between female genital cutting and correlates of sexual and gynaecological morbidity in Edo State, Nigeria.",
            "OBJECTIVE",
            "To examine the association between female genital cutting and frequency of sexual and gynaecological symptoms among a cohort of cut versus uncut women in Edo State of Nigeria.",
            "DESIGN",
            "Cross sectional study.",
            "SETTING",
            "Women attending family planning and antenatal clinics at three hospitals in Edo State, South-south Nigeria.",
            "POPULATION",
            "1836 healthy premenopausal women.",
            "METHODS",
            "The sample included 1836 women.",
            "Information about type of female genital cutting was based on medical exams while a structured questionnaire was used to elicit information on the women's sociodemographic characteristics, their ages of first menstruation (menarche), first intercourse, marriage and pregnancy, sexual history and experiences of symptoms of reproductive tract infections.",
            "Associations between female genital cutting and these correlates of sexual and gynaecologic morbidity were analysed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression and Cox models.",
            "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES",
            "Frequency of self-reported orgasm achieved during sexual intercourse and symptoms of reproductive tract infections.",
            "RESULTS",
            "Forty-five percent were circumcised and 71% had type 1, while 24% had type 2 female genital cutting.",
            "No significant differences between cut and uncut women were observed in the frequency of reports of sexual intercourse in the preceding week or month, the frequency of reports of early arousal during intercourse and the proportions reporting experience of orgasm during intercourse.",
            "There was also no difference between cut and uncut women in their reported ages of menarche, first intercourse or first marriage in the multivariate models controlling for the effects of socio-economic factors.",
            "In contrast, cut women were 1.25 times more likely to get pregnant at a given age than uncut women.",
            "Uncut women were significantly more likely to report that the clitoris is the most sexually sensitive part of their body (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.26-0.47), while cut women were more likely to report that their breasts are their most sexually sensitive body parts (OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.51-2.42).",
            "Cut women were significantly more likely than uncut women to report having lower abdominal pain (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.11-2.14), yellow bad-smelling vaginal discharge (OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.54-5.09), white vaginal discharge (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.09-2.49) and genital ulcers (OR = 4.38, 95% CI 1.13-17.00).",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "Female genital cutting in this group of women did not attenuate sexual feelings.",
            "However, female genital cutting may predispose women to adverse sexuality outcomes including early pregnancy and reproductive tract infections.",
            "Therefore, female genital cutting cannot be justified by arguments that suggest that it reduces sexual activity in women and prevents adverse outcomes of sexuality."

            "This paper investigates the gendered patterns and dynamics of labour exploitation and forced labour in the cocoa supply chain.",
            "The empirical basis of our analysis is an original primary dataset produced through the Global Business of Forced Labour project, which includes data gathered in Ghana in 2016\u20132017, comprising 60 in-depth interviews and a survey of 497 cocoa workers across 74 cocoa communities from Ghana\u2019s two largest cocoa-producing regions, the Western and Ashanti Regions.",
            "Drawing on this dataset, we show that prevailing business models within the Ghanaian cocoa industry rely on and reinforce labour exploitation and unequal gender power relations.",
            "Given that the links between forced labour and gender remain poorly understood, we analyse the factors that render women workers disproportionately vulnerable to severe labour exploitation, underscoring the role of unequal family relations, responsibility for reproductive labour, and social property relations in creating vulnerability to exploitation."
