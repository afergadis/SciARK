            "Objectives",
            "To quantitatively assess the relationships of childhood experiences of marriage, pregnancy, and sexual violence with underage sex trafficking.",
            "Methods",
            "Cross-sectional survey data from a population-based sample of 603 female sex workers from Tijuana and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, were collected in 2013 and 2014, and we analyzed the data to evaluate relationships between pregnancy, marriage, and sexual violence when younger than 16 years, and child sex trafficking.",
            "Results",
            "Adjusted odds of child sex trafficking among those who experienced pregnancy, marriage, and childhood sexual violence when younger than 16 years in combined models were 2.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.8, 4.3), 1.7 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.99, 2.8), and 1.7 (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01, 3.0), respectively, relative to others (n\u2009=\u2009603).",
            "For 89.8%, 78.0%, and 97.0% of those who had an experience of pregnancy (n\u2009=\u200969), marriage (n\u2009=\u200950), or sexual violence (n\u2009=\u200933) when younger than 16 years, respectively, the experience occurred before or the same year as sex trafficking.",
            "Conclusions",
            "These results provide empirical evidence of modifiable risk factors for child sex trafficking that could be integrated into the prevention efforts and protocols of health clinics and governmental agencies in Mexico currently working to reduce underage pregnancy, marriage, and sexual violence."

            "This rate is two times higher than most other European Union countries.",

            "Traffic-related injuries represent the leading cause of death for Polish men up to 44 years of age.",
            "The most common cause of road crashes in Poland was failure to comply with the rules of the road traffic, such as through excessive speeding.",

            "Analysis revealed ambiguity of mens wishes in regards to the continuation of FGM.",
            "Many men wished to abandon this practice because of the physical and psychosexual complications to both women and men.",
            "Social obligation and the silent culture between the sexes were posited as major obstacles for change.",
            "Support for abandonment was influenced by notions of social obligation, religion, education, ethnicity, urban living, migration, and understanding of the negative sequelae of FGM.",
            "The strongest influence was education.ConclusionThe level of education of men was one of the most important indicators for mens support for abandonment of FGM.",
            "Social obligation and the lack of dialogue between men and women were two key issues that men acknowledged as barriers to abandonment.",
            "Advocacy by men and collaboration between men and womens health and community programs may be important steps forward in the abandonment process."
