            "Using life cycle assessment (LCA) as a tool, this paper aims to find out which of the following two options for MSW disposal is more environmentally sustainable: incineration or recovery of biogas from landfills, each producing either electricity or co-generating heat and electricity.",
            "The systems are compared on a life cycle basis for two functional units: \u2018disposal of 1 tonne of MSW\u2019 and \u2018generation of 1kWh of electricity\u2019.",

            "The impacts of incineration co-generating heat and electricity are negative for nine out of 11 categories as the avoided impacts for the recovered energy and materials are higher than those caused by incineration.",
            "By improving the recovery rate of biogas, some impacts of landfilling, such as global warming, depletion of fossil resources, acidification and photochemical smog, would be significantly reduced.",

            "INTRODUCTION",
            "Understanding determinants of gender differences in economic and social domains has been of interest, both in academic and public debates.",
            "Previous research has shown that gender differences in fundamental economic preferences are important in explaining gender differences in economic outcomes, such as for occupational choice, financial investment, or educational decisions, among many others.",
            "However, gaps remain in understanding the sources of gender differences in preferences and their variation.",
            "RATIONALE",
            "We contrasted and tested two hypotheses that make opposite predictions concerning the cross-country association of gender differences in preferences with economic development and gender equality.",
            "On one hand, the attenuation of gender-specific social roles that arises in more developed and gender-egalitarian countries may alleviate differences in preferences between women and men.",
            "As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be negatively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (social role hypothesis).",
            "On the other hand, greater availability of material and social resources removes the gender-neutral goal of subsistence, which creates the scope for gender-specific ambitions and desires.",
            "In addition, more gender-equal access to those resources may allow women and men to express preferences independently from each other.",
            "As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be positively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (resource hypothesis).",
            "We tested these competing predictions using data on experimentally validated measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples.",
            "So that the data would be geographically representative, the dataset was chosen so as to include all continents and a broad range of cultures and economic development levels.",
            "In total, the data represent about 90% of both the world population and global income.",
            "RESULTS",
            "The data revealed substantial cross-country variation in gender differences in preferences.",
            "Gender differences were found to be strongly positively associated with economic development as well as gender equality.",
            "These relationships held for each preference separately as well as for a summary index of differences in all preferences jointly.",
            "Quantitatively, this summary index exhibited correlations of 0.67 (P < 0.0001) with log GDP per capita and 0.56 (P < 0.0001) with a Gender Equality Index (a joint measure of four indices of gender equality), respectively.",
            "To isolate the separate impacts of economic development and gender equality, we conducted a conditional analysis, finding a quantitatively large and statistically significant association between gender differences and log GDP per capita conditional on the Gender Equality Index, and vice versa.",

            "Whilst other services and utilities such as sewage, water, drainage and even modern day telecommunications have wisely been designed to be out of sight in the underground infrastructure, solid waste collection has commonly remained unchanged since the 19th century.",
            "Furthermore, traditional municipal waste handling in historical city centres is often made difficult by: old infrastructures; narrow, crooked streets that are not suitable for large waste collection vehicles; little space for rubbish bins, making at source separation difficult, and; high volumes of tourists that make traditional bins less accessible by waste operatives, which often conflicts with the objectives of keeping areas associated with tourism clean and hygienic.",
            "In these circumstances, underground vacuum waste collection arise as a revolutionary solution, even in remote areas.",
            "This waste management model lets integrate waste collection into the infrastructure of a building, a residential development a district or even entire towns, by transporting waste using vacuum technology through an underground network of pipes.",
            "The result, among other positive elements, is an average reduction in CO2 emissions above 90% compared with traditional collection models by truck."

            "The Republic of Ghana aims to develop and utilise renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to achieve a 10% penetration of national electricity production by 2020.",
            "The government also aims to achieve a 100% national electrification with renewable energy identified as the catalyst for achieving this policy goal.",
            "The situation however is, as of December 2017, Ghana has been able to achieve a 0.5% penetration rate of electricity from renewable energy sources in its total generation mix.",
            "This paper argues that Ghana is unable to reach its renewable energy target of 10% by 2020 given that it needs to integrate 9.5% of renewables from 2018 to 2020 whiles it has only been able to achieve 0.5% penetration rate since 2006.",
            "Legal and regulatory issues such as lack of legislative instruments by regulatory agencies incumbent upon achieving the renewable energy policy target, lack of independence of institution structure and the lack of regulatory assessment are some of the key reasons behind this argument.",
            "The implication of these issues is that, investors lose confidence in the government's ability to maintain and achieve both current and future renewable energy policy goals.",
            "Investors become uncertain and this leads to underinvestment in renewable projects and subsequently, failure in achieving renewable energy targets."

            "A questionnaire survey, covering 2269 households, gathered data on socio-economic contexts and issues influencing a transition towards clean cooking facilities.",
            "The findings reveal that the transition is impeded by four factors: the lack of motivation and the pressure for switching over to cleaner facilities, the lack of modern energy technology options, the financial risks, and the lack of financing and other support.",
            "The paper describes the delicate two-way interrelation between women earning wages and the transitions to cleaner cooking fuels and technologies.",
            "The findings suggest the need for a policy framework involving the stakeholders, financing and standardised technologies.",
            "To make a change it is proposed to introduce a national, integrated policy incorporating financing and energy governance."

            "Abstract",
            "Multiple studies have found that women report being in worse health despite living longer.",
            "Gender gaps vary cross-nationally, but relatively little is known about the causes of comparative differences.",

            "Gender gaps in subjective health vary visibly across Europe.",
            "In many countries (especially in Eastern and Southern Europe), women report distinctly worse health, while in others (such as Estonia, Finland, and Great Britain) there are small or no differences.",
            "Logistic regressions ran separately for each country revealed that individual-level socioeconomic and demographic variables explain a majority of these gaps in some countries, but contribute little to their understanding in most countries.",
            "In yet other countries, men had worse health when these variables were controlled for.",
            "Cross-national variation in the gender gaps exists after accounting for individual-level factors.",
            "Against expectations, the remaining gaps are not systematically related to societal-level gender inequality in the multilevel analyses.",
            "Our findings stress persistent cross-national variability in gender gaps in health and call for further analysis."
