            "Abstract",
            "The main objective of this study is to determine the factors affecting households\u2019 fuel type choices for space heating; this is accomplished using both ordered and unordered discrete choice models utilising the data of 93,119 households.",
            "The data are drawn from Turkish Statistical Institute Household Budget Surveys (THBS) between 2003 and 2011 under three distinctive scenarios.",
            "The results reveal that there is a statistically significant and strong relationship between households\u2019 fuel type choices for space heating and household head's gender, occupation group, household income, household size, type of dwelling, type of space heating system, dwelling size, number of rooms in the dwelling, settlement and region.",
            "The empirical evidence indicates that households still rely on traditional fuel types, especially in the rural areas of Turkey.",
            "For the model comparison, the ordered response models outperform the unordered response models in one of the three scenarios.",
            "Thus, we suggest that ordered response models can also be performed to estimate households\u2019 fuel type choice behaviour.",
            "As far as we know, this is the first attempt that simultaneously compares both ordered and unordered choice models using a Turkish sample.",
            "The empirical evidence can help shed light on Turkish households\u2019 fuel stacking behaviour for future energy policies."

            "However, the environment \u2013 and especially climate change \u2013 is hyper-polarized amongst the American public, and non-environmental justifications for renewable energy may resonate more broadly.",
            "Using a 2016 mail survey of individuals living in five states in the Rocky Mountain region of the U.S., we examine predictors of public approval of renewable energy usage, approval of a 20% renewable portfolio standard policy, and agreement with seven frames for renewable energy, of which four referenced the environment and three did not.",
            "We build upon previous research by analyzing geographic variation in frame agreement and by testing a religious environmental stewardship and resource-conservation frame.",
            "Results indicate high approval renewable energy but mixed support for the policy measure.",
            "Respondents on average agreed with all seven renewable energy frames, with energy security and energy diversification receiving the most support.",
            "Of the four environmental frames, air pollution and resource conservation had the most support, and the religion and climate frames had the least.",
            "We note variation by state, particularly on support for the policy measure.",
            "Political ideology and belief in human-caused global warming were consistent predictors, though gender, residence in a metro county, neoliberal ideology, and state of residence were also important.",
            "Overall, our results echo other research indicating that non-climate-based frames for renewable energy are likely to garner broader public support, but we suggest that the significance of this finding is particularly important in certain political and geographical contexts."

            "The causes of poor respiratory function and COPD are incompletely understood, but it is clear that genes and the environment play a role.",
            "As DNA methylation is under both genetic and environmental control, we hypothesised that investigation of differential methylation associated with these phenotypes would permit mechanistic insights, and improve prediction of COPD.",
            "We investigated genome-wide differential DNA methylation patterns using the recently released 850K Illumina EPIC array in the largest single population sample to date.",

            "The number of CpG loci analysed range from 27,578 to 485,512.",
            "These studies have not identified consistent changes in methylation, most likely due to a combination of factors including small sample sizes, technical issues, phenotypic definitions, and study design.",
            "In addition, no previous study has: analysed a sample from a large single cohort; used the recently released Illumina EPIC array (which assesses ~850,000 CpG loci); adjusted methylation data and phenotype for smoking history, or used both prevalent and incident COPD electronic health record data.",

            "To our knowledge, this is the largest single cohort epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of respiratory function and COPD to date (N=3,791).",
            "After applying stringent genome-wide significance criteria (P &lt;3.6\u00d710\u22128), we found that DNA methylation levels at 29 CpG sites in peripheral blood were associated with respiratory function or COPD.",
            "Of these 29, seven were testable in an independent population sample: all seven showed consistent direction of effect between the two samples and three showed replication (p&lt;0.007 [0.05/7 CpG sites tested]).",
            "Our results suggest that adjustment of both the phenotypic and the DNA methylation probe data for smoking history, which has not been carried out in previous studies, reduces the confounding effects of smoking, identifies larger numbers of associations, and reduces the heterogeneity of effects across smoking strata.",
            "We used gene set enrichment and pathway analyses, together with an approach that combines DNA methylation results with gene expression data to provide evidence for enrichment of differentially methylated sites in genes linked to alternative splicing, and JAK-STAT signalling and axon guidance.",
            "Finally, we demonstrated that the inclusion of DNA methylation data improves COPD risk prediction over established clinical variables alone in two independent datasets.",
            "",
            "Implications of all the available evidence",
            "There is now accumulating evidence that DNA methylation in peripheral blood is associated with respiratory function and COPD.",
            "Our study has shown that DNA methylation levels at 29 CpG sites are robustly associated with respiratory function and COPD, provide mechanistic insights, and can improve prediction of COPD risk.",

            "Patterns of diversification in islands: A comparative study across three gecko genera in the Socotra Archipelago",
            "Abstract: In this study we used the complete fauna of geckos of the Socotra Archipelago to test whether the three gecko genera co-occurring in the islands (Pristurus, Hemidactylus and Haemodracon) produced similar outcomes of morphological and climatic diversification.",
            "To test this, we produced a time-calibrated tree of 346 geckos including all 16 endemic species of the archipelago and 26 potential close-relatives in the continent.",
            "Our dating estimates revealed that most of the diversity of geckos in the archipelago was the consequence of in situ diversification.",
            "However not all genera shared similar patterns of diversification.",
            "While in Hemidactylus and Haemodracon this involved great differences in body size and low levels of climatic diversification (mostly involving sympatric distributions), an opposite pattern appeared in Pristurus in which most of the diversification involved shifts in climatic envelopes (mostly involving allopatric and parapatric distributions) but almost no size differentiation.",
            "Consistently with this, Pristurus was the only genus in which rates of size diversification in islands were substantially lower than in the continent.",
            "This illustrates how different groups can greatly differ in their patterns of intra-island diversification and highlights the importance of taxon-dependent factors at determining different patterns of diversification in the same insular context."

            "Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface.",
            "Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15\u201337% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be \u2018committed to extinction\u2019.",
            "When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (\u223c18%) than mid-range (\u223c24%) and maximum-change (\u223c35%) scenarios.",
            "These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration."
