            "Using the Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL) as a case study, we examine the consequent climate feedbacks and the impacts of revegetation on regional climate by incorporating high-resolution remote-sensing vegetation data into the WRF-Noah model.",
            "From 2001 to 2010, although a small portion of the grassland was degraded in MUSL, vegetation overall improved, with green fraction and leaf area index increased and surface albedo decreased.",
            "The model simulation suggests a cooling of the near-surface temperature by 0.12\u20130.32 \u00b0C on average and up to >0.5 \u00b0C in summer, with a reduction in nighttime minimum of 0.15\u20130.46 \u00b0C and in daytime maximum of <0.13 \u00b0C.",
            "The cooling is accompanied by a slight increase in 2-m air humidity.",
            "The near-surface cooling and wetting are induced by revegetation-enhanced evapotranspiration, but they have insignificant effect on the local precipitation.",
            "The results of this study imply that while revegetation has positive effects on the ecological systems in MUSL, it bears the cost of an increase in evapotranspiration of 51 mm per summer, which may exacerbate the water shortages in the region."

            "Methods: The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) was used to estimate reductions in all-cause child mortality due to changes in coverage of treatment for the integrated community case management (iCCM) illnesses - malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea - while accounting for other changes in maternal and child health interventions in each RAcE project area.",
            "Data from RAcE baseline and endline household surveys, Demographic and Health Surveys, and routine health service data were used in each LiST model.",

            "Results: The LiST model accounts for coverage changes in iCCM intervention coverage and other health trends in each project area to estimate mortality reduction and child lives saved.",
            "Under five mortality declined in all six RAcE sites, with an average decline of 10 percent.",
            "An estimated 6200 under-five lives were saved by malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea treatment in the DRC, Malawi, Niger, and Nigeria, of which approximately 4940 (75 percent) were saved by treatment provided by CHWs.",
