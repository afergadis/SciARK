            "Title: The future of Earth observation in hydrology",
            "Abstract: In just the past 5 years, the field of Earth observation has progressed beyond the offerings of conventional space-agency-based platforms to include a plethora of sensing opportunities afforded by CubeSats, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and smartphone technologies that are being embraced by both for-profit companies and individual researchers.",
            "Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically of the order of 1 billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines of the order of 2 decades (for new missions).",
            "More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturize sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing ultra-high (3\u20135\u202fm) resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis.",
            "Start-up companies that did not exist a decade ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency, and at costs that are a mere fraction of traditional satellite missions.",
            "With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as real-time high-definition video for tracking air pollution, storm-cell development, flood propagation, precipitation monitoring, or even for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques.",
            "Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-metre resolutions, pushing back on spatio-temporal constraints and delivering new process insights.",
            "At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizen scientists to catalogue photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and sense other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices.",
            "Global internet access is being pursued via high-altitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the internet of things as an entirely new measurement domain.",
            "Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms.",
            "This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret.",
            "The extent to which today's hydrologic models can usefully ingest such massive data volumes is unclear.",
            "Nor is it clear whether this deluge of data will be usefully exploited, either because the measurements are superfluous, inconsistent, not accurate enough, or simply because we lack the capacity to process and analyse them.",
            "What is apparent is that the tools and techniques afforded by this array of novel and game-changing sensing platforms present our community with a unique opportunity to develop new insights that advance fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences.",
            "To accomplish this will require more than just an application of the technology: in some cases, it will demand a radical rethink on how we utilize and exploit these new observing systems."

            "Australia's coastal cities and towns, with over 85 per cent of the nation's population, are at the frontline of physical risks associated with sea level rise and changed weather patterns; exacerbated by ongoing concentration of public and private assets in potentially vulnerable locations.",

            "The audit indicates some areas are well underway towards holistic adaptation strategies but, others have neither engaged, nor anticipate, adaptation planning activities; of the strategies that have commenced, few are yet completed; and, despite ongoing development pressure, few councils have yet changed their planning controls for climate risk.",

            "Abstract Green and renewable bio-diesel prepared from oils catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) will have a great impact on clean energy structure and industrial application.",
            "The core issue of catalytic oils HDO research is still the development of catalysts with high performance, and it has become the research focus of researchers in recent years.",
            "The bio-diesel after deoxygenationis similar to petroleum fuel in composition, which has better fuelproperties because of its higher cetane number, higher energy density, and very low sulfur content.",
            "Therefore, the prepared bio-diesel can be employed directly in fuel industry.",
            "In order to ensure that the catalyst has superior deoxidization performances, it should have good \u201cH-H\u201d dissociation ability, \u201cC-O\u201d and \u201cC=O\u201d adsorption and activation abilities.",
            "To obtain the expected products, feasible production processes, and suitable catalyst systems are needed.",

            "In addition, this review also involed the effects of support, promoters, interaction between active components and support on the HDO activity and selectivity, and detailed information about the reaction mechanism.",
            "The HDO performances of the corresponding catalyst can be effectively improved by optimizing the active components and controlling the properties of the support.",
            "The catalyst used into the HDO reaction is mainly concentrated on the supported catalyst.",
            "In addition, the choice of the support is based on the prepared catalyst with the best physical and chemical properties.",

            "Abstract",
            "Background: Although Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is internationally considered a harmful practice, it is increasingly being medicalized allegedly to reduce its negative health effects, and is thus suggested as a harm reduction strategy in response to these perceived health risks.",
            "In many countries where FGM/C is traditionally practiced, the prevalence rates of medicalization are increasing, and in countries of migration, such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America or Sweden, court cases or the repeated issuing of statements in favor of presumed minimal forms of FGM/C to replace more invasive forms, has raised the debate between the medical harm reduction arguments and the human rights approach.",
            "Main body: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the arguments associated with the medicalization of FGM/C, a trend that could undermine the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 5.3.",
            "The paper uses four country case studies, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya and UK, to discuss the reasons for engaging in medicalized forms of FGM/C, or not, and explores the ongoing public discourse in those countries concerning harm reduction versus human rights, and the contradiction between medical ethics, national criminal justice systems and international conventions.",
            "The discussion is structured around four key hotly contested ethical dilemmas.",
            "Firstly, that the WHO definition of medicalized FGM/C is too narrow allowing medicalized FGM to be justified by many healthcare professionals as a form of harm reduction which contradicts the medical oath of do no harm.",
            "Secondly, that medicalized FGM/C is a human rights abuse with lifelong consequences, no matter who performs it.",
            "Thirdly, that health care professionals who perform medicalized FGM/C are sustaining cultural norms that they themselves support and are also gaining financially.",
            "Fourthly, the contradiction between protecting traditional cultural rights in legal constitutions versus human rights legislation, which criminalizes FGM/C.",
            "Conclusion: More research needs to be done in order to understand the complexities that are facilitating the medicalization of FGM/C as well as how policy strategies can be strengthened to have a greater de-medicalization impact.",
            "Tackling medicalization of FGM/C will accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal of ending FGM by 2030"

            "Interviews were conducted with 16 participants aged 16-20 who were unemployed and not eligible for upper secondary school, or who had dropped out of school.",
            "Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis illustrating how the young people perceive their life experiences in relation to health and well-being: Struggling with hardships in the absence of caring connections, Feeling good when closely connected to others, and Being forced to question what has been taken for granted.",
            "Each theme consists of 2-3 subthemes.",
            "Conclusion: Based on the young people's narrated experiences health can be understood as: something that is created in relation to others and in relation to the social and cultural context; as something dynamic and changeable; as the ability to adapt and respond to challenges; and finally as something existing on a collective as well as an individual level.",
            "Implications for school, social services and health promotion initiatives are discussed, with an emphasis on working with young people."

            "The two primary objectives of recent energy initiatives and/or policies are the reducing of both domestic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and our dependence on foreign oil commodities.",
            "Republican senators Richard Lugar, Lindsay Graham, and Lisa Murkowski introduced the \u201cPrimary Energy Plan Act of 2011\u201d with plans of: (1) reducing U.S. dependency on foreign oil; (2) increasing investment in more diverse, cleaner energy producing technologies; and (3) better utilizing domestic fossil fuel resources.",
            "The bill hoped to accomplish such goals through increases in existing fuel economy standards for light-duty vehicles and improvements in the energy efficiency standards for residential, commercial, and federal buildings.",
            "It also established incentives for the production.",
            "President Obama in that same year expressed plans for a clean energy standard (CES) requiring 80% of total produced electricity to be generated from a select group of clean energy sources (e.g.",
            "coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS), nuclear, solar, wind, etc.).",
            "He later proposed a tightening of current Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations, doubling the average fuel efficiency of the light-duty fleet.",
            "These initiatives highlight our nations\u2019 efforts to curb our dependency on non-domestic energy sources.",
            "Increases in energy independence refer to reductions in domestic need for foreign oil products.",
            "In 1975, U.S. oil imports composted roughly 37% of total domestic oil consumption \u2013 rising to 57% in 2008.",
            "In a little over thirty years, we have witnessed a 20% increase in oil imports, indicative of our growing addiction for foreign oil.",
            "Severe volatility in oil prices, not to mention that several reserves are located within politically unstable nations, drive policymakers\u2019 concerns that our increasing reliance on foreign is becoming ever more dangerous.",
            "Petroleum in 2010 composed almost 37% percent of overall energy consumption here in the U.S.",
            "Almost 70% of that came from the transportation sector alone.",
            "Thus, there lies a direct correlation between the growing consumption of oil by the transportation sector and our rising need for imported oil.",
            "There are existing mechanisms in place targeting transportation emissions and energy usage.",
            "The CAFE standard was initially developed under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPACT) as a direct result of the 1973 Arab oil embargo.",
            "It reduced sector emissions and fuel demands through improvements in the fuel economy of cars and light-duty trucks.",
            "Market-based fuel taxes like gasoline and diesel taxes are other alternatives that dampen the appeal of using dirtier, conventional fuels.",
            "The federal excise tax on gasoline today is 18.4 cents per gallon and 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel.",
            "State and local taxes average 30.5 cents and 29.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and diesel, respectively.",
            "Considering both the federal and state level taxes, the average U.S. fuel taxes are roughly 49 cents per gallon of gasoline and 54 cents per gallon of diesel.",
            "Relative to other nations, U.S. fuel tax levels are more on the lower end.",
            "Our work builds upon previous studies which have taken a look at the impacts of different transportation-based policies geared towards lowering GHG emissions and curbing our country\u2019s appetite for foreign oil.",
            "The policies analyzed will be compared based on their ability to strengthen domestic energy independence and reduce GHG emissions.",
            "We use the recent 2010 US EPA MARKAL dynamic, partial equilibrium model, which uses a detailed structure of the US energy system, to model and observe each policy.",
            "In addition, we will observe how these mechanisms stand to affect the largest contributor to our country\u2019s energy security problem, the transportation sector."
