            "Clitoral reconstruction following female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is a new surgical technique reported to be a feasible and effective strategy to reduce clitoral pain, improve sexual pleasure, and restore a vulvar appearance similar to uncircumcised women.",
            "However, data on safety, care offered, and evaluation of sexual and pain outcomes are still limited.",
            "AIMS",
            "This study aims to present the care offered and clinical outcomes of two women who received multidisciplinary care, including psychosexual treatment, with clitoral reconstruction.",
            "We report their long-term outcomes, and the histology of the removed periclitoral fibrosis.",
            "METHODS",
            "We report the cases of two women with FGM/C types II and III who requested clitoral reconstruction for different reasons.",
            "One woman hoped to improve her chronic vulvar pain, as well as improve her sexual response.",
            "The other woman requested surgery due to a desire to reverse a procedure that was performed without her consent, and a wish to have a genital appearance similar to non infibulated women.",
            "They both underwent psychosexual evaluation and therapy and surgery.",
            "The histology of the periclitoral fibrosis removed during surgery was analyzed.",
            "RESULTS",
            "At 1-year postoperatively, the first woman reported complete disappearance of vulvar pain and improved sexual pleasure, including orgasm.",
            "Our second patient also described improved sexuality at 1-year follow-up (increased sexual desire, lubrication, vulvar pleasure, and sensitiveness), which she attributed to a better self body image and confidence.",
            "Both women reported feeling satisfied, happy, and more beautiful.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "We show a positive outcome in pain reduction and improved sexual function, self body image, and gender after psychosexual therapy and clitoral reconstruction.",
            "More evidence is needed about clitoral reconstruction to develop guidelines on best practices.",
            "Until research is conducted that rigorously evaluates clitoral reconstruction for its impact on pain and sexuality, we advise always offering a multidisciplinary care, including sexual therapy before and after the surgery."

            "Married women's ability to negotiate for safer sex is important for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya.",

            "Our sample included 8,602 married women.",
            "Two indicators of safer sex, namely the ability to refuse sex and the ability to ask for condom use, were explored.",
            "RESULTS",
            "We found that women who had undergone genital mutilation were significantly less likely to report that they can refuse sex (OR=0.87; p<.05) and that they can ask for condom use during sexual intercourse (OR=0.62; p<.001) than their counterparts who had not undergone genital mutilation, while controlling for theoretically relevant variables.",
            "CONCLUSION",
            "Our findings indicate that the experience of female genital mutilation may influence married women's ability to negotiate for safer sex through gendered socialization and expectations.",

            "Background/aims: The aim of this prospective study was to estimate gender differences in anxiety, depression, and alcohol use severity among patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) before and after detoxification program and within 12 months after discharge.",
            "Methods: AUD severity, state and trait anxiety, and depression were assessed in 187 patients entering an inpatient alcohol detoxification program.",
            "Follow-up assessments were performed at 6 and 12 months after discharge.",
            "A between- and within-subjects analyses explored gender differences.",

            "Child marriage remains highly prevalent in Africa, especially in rural areas and among vulnerable socio-economic groups (UNFPA 2012; UNICEF 2014; Nguyen and Wodon 2015a).",
            "Physiological and social criteria suggest that most boys and girls aged 14 and younger are much too young for sexual, marital, and reproductive transitions, while many among the 15\u201317-year-olds are also too young (Dixon-Mueller 2008).",
            "Child marriage, defined here as marriage before the age of 18, is known to have negative impacts on health as well as educational attainment, labor force participation, intimate partner violence, and empowerment (for a review, see Parsons et al.",

            "Results suggest that it does, with higher child marriage among Muslim, Animist/traditional belief populations, and those without a faith affiliation in comparisons to Catholics and Protestants.",
            "The second objective of the article, which is the focus of the following section, is to caution against broad generalizations about child marriage and faith affiliation, in order to show that beyond stylized facts derived from household survey data, there is also substantial heterogeneity within the adherents of any particular faith as to how the practice of child marriage is considered.",
            "The analysis focuses on Islamic communities.",
            "As pointed out by Lewis and Lockheed (2007), many Islamic communities throughout the world have managed to sharply reduce the prevalence of child marriage and have embraced girls\u2019 education and women's employment.",
            "The heterogeneity of attitudes towards child marriage is illustrated with a case study for rural Muslim communities in Burkina Faso, based on previous work by Gemignani and Wodon (2015a, 2015b).",
            "The analysis suggests that child marriage does have deep socio-cultural and religious roots.",
            "Gender roles and social expectations, as well as prevailing conceptions about Islamic Law and the fear of pregnancy before marriage, all play a role in the persistence of the practice.",
            "But at the same time there are also important differences in the drivers of child marriage between communities, suggesting that policy and program responses to child marriage should take into account local conditions\u2014including those pertaining to faith\u2014if they are to be successful."

            "It summarizes the mortality patterns and health outcomes of various population groups such as women and men.",
            "Thus, LE can indicate health inequalities in the population.",
            "Even in the European Union (EU) with common goals and values and a common economic area, LE still differs between countries, and varies along sociodemographic variables.",
            "To reduce inequalities is a matter of fairness and as such should be of public interest.",
            "This paper puts gender inequalities in the focus.",
            "In EU 28 Member States LE at birth reached 83.3 years (women) and 77.9 years (men) on average in 2015.1 The gender gap in life expectancy (GGLE) at birth has narrowed from 6.4 years (2002) to 5.4 years (2015) on EU average but the size of this gender gap still varies substantially in Europe.1 As biological differences appear to play a minor role in explaining the GGLE,2,3 differences in social relationships or health-risk behaviour gain attention.4,5",
            "Men benefit more than women from the expansion of LE.",
            "For example, in the Netherlands, male LE increased between 1990 and 2015 by 8%, female LE by 4%.",
            "In other EU countries a comparable trend can be observed.",
            "As possible theoretical explanations for this trend, diminishment of gender inequality,3 role expansion theory (undertaking of different social roles such as paid work, child care and household activities),3 or convergence in unhealthy behaviours (reduction of risk behaviour in men, adoption of risk behaviour in women or both) are discussed.4 Social relationships and health-risk behaviour are shaped by social norms but studies on the influence of societal factors on LE are rare.6 Gender inequality, i.e.",
            "unequal distribution of wealth, power and benefits among women and men, is one of the most important societal factors.",
            "Gender inequality is socially determined and as such it is open to change by gender equality policies.7 Some studies have shown an association between gender inequality and health indicators on a national or international level.",
            "Gender inequality is associated with child and infant mortality8,9 as well as with men\u2019s health.3 Our paper addresses the question of whether gender inequality is also interrelated with the GGLE as well as to LE in both genders.",
            "The rationale is that gender differences in health related behaviours contribute to the gender gap in mortality and thus to LE, as behaviour is influenced by gender norms.",
            "We hypothesize that the GGLE is smaller in countries with more gender equality.",
            "With our analysis we want to contribute to the debate on reducing health inequalities between women and men.",

            "We conducted an ecological study to investigate the association between gender inequality and (gender gap in) LE at birth in EU 28 Member States.",
            "To assess gender inequality we used the gender inequality index (GII) produced by the United Nations Development Programme with data from 2015 being the most recent available.",
            "The GII measures loss of human development in three dimensions with five indicators: reproductive health (maternal mortality ratio, adolescent birth rate), political empowerment (share of parliamentary seats held by each sex, attainment at secondary and higher education levels) and economic status (labour market participation rate).",
            "It ranges from 0, where women and men score equally, to 1, where one gender scores as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions.10 We calculated the GGLE (2015) by subtracting the LE of men from that of women.",
            "Using GII scores and GGLE data we computed Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient and created a scatter plot.",
            "Results",

            "In 2015 the GII varies for EU 28 member states between 0.041 (Denmark) and 0.339 (Romania).",

            "male LE with GII separately, shows even a stronger, moderate correlation coefficient of 0.418 (women) and 0.430 (men) (see Appendix).",
            "Conclusions",
            "The results show a positive, although weak correlation between GGLE and GII in the expected direction: the lower the gender inequality on a national level the smaller the GGLE.",
            "Gender inequality is not only associated with the GGLE but also with the LE itself.",
            "The correlation is even stronger than the association between GGLE and GII.",
            "Both results indicate that gender inequality is related to the health of women and men.",
            "The fact that in men a moderate correlation between LE and GII can also be observed, proves a positive association between gender equality and men\u2019s health.",
            "It could be cautiously interpreted that convergence of behaviours as well as expansion of roles as consequences of increasing gender equality might influence the LE of women and men.",
            "The limitation of the study is that the health dimension \u2018maternal mortality ratio\u2019 is part of the GII.",
            "The maternal mortality ratio itself affects the LE of women in the direction that higher maternal mortality ratios lead to lower life expectancies for women and thus to a reduction of the GGLE.",
            "However, the maternal mortality ratio is rather low in EU 28 Member States and differs between three deaths per 100 000 live births (Finland, Greece and Poland) and 31 death per 100 000 live births (Romania).",
            "Therefore, the influence on LE seems limited.",

            "Background: While in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia, higher education and research institutions are widely engaged with the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science to advance gender equality, empirical research on this process and its impact is rare.",
            "This study combined two data sets (free- text comments from a survey and qualitative interviews) to explore the range of experiences and perceptions of participation in Athena SWAN in medical science departments of a research-intensive university in Oxford, United Kingdom.",
            "Methods: The study is based on the secondary analysis of data from two projects: 59 respondents to an anonymous online survey (42 women, 17 men) provided relevant free-text comments and, separately, 37 women participated in face-to-face narrative interviews.",
            "Free-text survey comments and narrative interviews were analysed thematically using constant comparison.",
            "Results: Both women and men said that participation in Athena SWAN had brought about important structural and cultural changes, including increased support for women's careers, greater appreciation of caring responsibilities, and efforts to challenge discrimination and bias.",
            "Many said that these positive changes would not have happened without linkage of Athena SWAN to government research funding, while others thought there were unintended consequences.",
            "Concerns about the programme design and implementation included a perception that Athena SWAN has limited ability to address longstanding and entrenched power and pay imbalances, persisting lack of work-life balance in academic medicine, questions about the sustainability of positive changes, belief that achieving the award could become an end in itself, resentment about perceived positive discrimination, and perceptions that further structural and cultural changes were needed in the university and wider society.",
            "Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that Athena SWAN has a positive impact in advancing gender equality, but there may be limits to how much it can improve gender equality without wider institutional and societal changes.",
            "To address the fundamental causes of gender inequality would require cultural change and welfare state policies incentivising men to increase their participation in unpaid work in the family, which is beyond the scope of higher education and research policy."

            "Historical climate data were obtained from the years 1961 to 2000 (baseline climate) and for three future climate scenarios in the years 2030 and 2070 (with low and medium rates of warming), which were created using projected changes in the baseline climate; representing progressively warmer conditions.",

            "With warming, a site with a C4-based pasture system became significantly more productive and with a lower GHG emissions intensity, whereas some grazing systems may need to adapt their pasture-base to maintain productivity and minimise emissions intensity in the future.",

            "While the literature on environmental factors in civil wars is rich in empirical research and explanatory power, the dearth of data is an obstacle to the study of other important forms of violence such as pastoral conflict.",
            "If environmental factors are associated with pastoral conflict then what are they, and can they be used as early warning indicators to prevent its escalation or mitigate its effects?",
            "These questions are increasingly important given the expected impact of climate change on pastoral societies worldwide.",
            "To help answer these questions we draw on data collected by field monitors with the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development's (IGAD) Conflict Early Warning and Response Network (CEWARN) and environmental data for the same region.",

            "Preliminary statistical analyses of the data suggest that aggravating behavior, along with a reduction in peace initiatives and reciprocal exchanges, is associated with an escalation in pastoral conflict, particularly when coupled with an increase in vegetation that may provide cover for organized raids.",
            "We therefore recommend that conflict early warning systems integrate both response options and salient environmental indicators into their analyses to better deal with the complexity of the relationships between pastoral conflict and the environment in an era of climate change."

            "The aim of this study was threefold: to describe the landscape of gender-transformative programmes that attempt to influence health-related outcomes; to identify mechanisms through which successful programmes work; and to highlight where gaps might exist in implementation and evaluation.",
            "Methods: We systematically reviewed rigorous evaluations published between Jan 1, 2000, and Nov 1, 2018 of programmes that sought to decrease gender inequalities and transform restrictive gender norms to improve the health and wellbeing of 0\u201324 year olds.",
            "We included rigorously evaluated health programmes that met the Interagency Gender Working Group definition of gender-transformative programming, regardless of where in the world they were implemented and what area of health they focused on.",
            "Findings: Among 22 993 articles identified by our search, 61 evaluations of 59 programmes met review criteria.",
            "Programmes were concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa (25 [42%]), south Asia (13 [22%]), and North America (13 [22%]) and mainly measured health indicators related to reproductive health (29 [48%]), violence (26 [43%]), or HIV (18 [30%]).",
            "Programmes most frequently focused on improving the individual power of the beneficiaries, rather than working on broader systems of inequality.",
            "45 (74%) of the evaluations measured significant improvements in health-related and gender-related indicators; however, only ten (16%) showed evidence of, or potential for, broader norm change.",
            "These ten programmes worked with sectors beyond health, included multiple stakeholders, implemented diversified strategies, and fostered critical awareness and participation among affected community members.",
            "Interpretation: This review can accelerate efforts to improve global health by leading to more strategic investment in programmes that promote gender equality and target restrictive gender norms among young people.",
