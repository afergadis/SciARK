            "INTRODUCTION",
            "Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), also known as female circumcision, is an ancient traditional procedure that involves partial or total removal of the female external genitalia for nonmedical reasons.",

            "This cross-sectional study was conducted during a 36-month period from 2010 to 2013 in Hormozgan, a southern province of Iran near the Persian Gulf.",
            "We included 780 women in six major rural areas of the province who referred to healthcare centers for vaccination, midwifery, or family planning services.",
            "All participants underwent complete pelvic examination to determine the type of FGM.",

            "FGM/C was associated with higher age (P\u2009=\u20090.002), Afghan nationality (P\u2009=\u20090.003), Sunni Islam as religion (P\u2009=\u20090.019), illiteracy (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and family history of FGM/C in mother (P\u2009<\u20090.001), sister (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and grandmother (P\u2009<\u20090.001).",

            "The proposed astronomical empirical climate model assumes that the climate is resonating with, or synchronized to a set of natural harmonics that, in previous works (Scafetta, 2010b, 2011b), have been associated to the solar system planetary motion, which is mostly determined by Jupiter and Saturn.",

            "The 9.1-year cycle is shown to be likely related to a decadal Soli/Lunar tidal oscillation, while the 10\u201310.5, 20\u201321 and 60\u201362 year cycles are synchronous to solar and heliospheric planetary oscillations.",
            "We show that the IPCC GCM's claim that all warming observed from 1970 to 2000 has been anthropogenically induced is erroneous because of the GCM failure in reconstructing the quasi 20-year and 60-year climatic cycles.",
            "Finally, we show how the presence of these large natural cycles can be used to correct the IPCC projected anthropogenic warming trend for the 21st century.",
            "By combining this corrected trend with the natural cycles, we show that the temperature may not significantly increase during the next 30 years mostly because of the negative phase of the 60-year cycle.",
            "If multisecular natural cycles (which according to some authors have significantly contributed to the observed 1700\u20132010 warming and may contribute to an additional natural cooling by 2100) are ignored, the same IPCC projected anthropogenic emissions would imply a global warming by about 0.3\u20131.2\u00b0C by 2100, contrary to the IPCC 1.0\u20133.6\u00b0C projected warming.",
            "The results of this paper reinforce previous claims that the relevant physical mechanisms that explain the detected climatic cycles are still missing in the current GCMs and that climate variations at the multidecadal scales are astronomically induced and, in first approximation, can be forecast."

            "Methods:                    We conducted a population-based cohort study to compare mortality among 238,292 persons who purchased a handgun in California in 1991 with that in the general adult population of the state.",

            "Results:                    In the first year after the purchase of a handgun, suicide was the leading cause of death among handgun purchasers, accounting for 24.5 percent of all deaths and 51.9 percent of deaths among women 21 to 44 years old.",
            "The increased risk of suicide by any method among handgun purchasers (standardized mortality ratio, 4.31) was attributable entirely to an excess risk of suicide with a firearm (standardized mortality ratio, 7.12).",
            "In the first week after the purchase of a handgun, the rate of suicide by means of firearms among purchasers (644 per 100,000 person-years) was 57 times as high as the adjusted rate in the general population.",
            "Mortality from all causes during the first year after the purchase of a handgun was greater than expected for women (standardized mortality ratio, 1.09), and the entire increase was attributable to the excess number of suicides by means of a firearm.",
            "As compared with the general population, handgun purchasers remained at increased risk for suicide by firearm over the study period of up to six years, and the excess risk among women in this cohort (standardized mortality ratio, 15.50) remained greater than that among men (standardized mortality ratio, 3.23).",

            "Non-linear programming was used to adjust monthly diets fed to 10 cattle groups to minimize EI associated with an average United States dairy farm.",

            "Diminishing environmental returns to cost increases were apparent.",
            "Cost of achieving a 25% reduction in the environmental impacts considered in this study was decreased 78.9% when energy and protein efficiency improved compared with the national average production efficiency scenario.",
