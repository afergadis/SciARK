            "Evaluating strategies for control of tuberculosis in prisons and prevention of spillover into communities: An observational and modeling study from Brazil",
            "Background: It has been hypothesized that prisons serve as amplifiers of general tuberculosis (TB) epidemics, but there is a paucity of data on this phenomenon and the potential population-level effects of prison-focused interventions.",
            "This study (1) quantifies the TB risk for prisoners as they traverse incarceration and release, (2) mathematically models the impact of prison-based interventions on TB burden in the general population, and (3) generalizes this model to a wide range of epidemiological contexts.",
            "Methods and findings: We obtained individual-level incarceration data for all inmates (n = 42,925) and all reported TB cases (n = 5,643) in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul from 2007 through 2013.",
            "We matched individuals between prisoner and TB databases and estimated the incidence of TB from the time of incarceration and the time of prison release using Cox proportional hazards models.",
            "We identified 130 new TB cases diagnosed during incarceration and 170 among individuals released from prison.",
            "During imprisonment, TB rates increased from 111 cases per 100,000 person-years at entry to a maximum of 1,303 per 100,000 person-years at 5.2 years.",
            "At release, TB incidence was 229 per 100,000 person-years, which declined to 42 per 100,000 person-years (the average TB incidence in Brazil) after 7 years.",
            "We used these data to populate a compartmental model of TB transmission and incarceration to evaluate the effects of various prison-based interventions on the incidence of TB among prisoners and the general population.",
            "Annual mass TB screening within Brazilian prisons would reduce TB incidence in prisons by 47.4% (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI], 44.4%-52.5%) and in the general population by 19.4% (95% BCI 17.9%-24.2%).",
            "A generalized model demonstrates that prison-based interventions would have maximum effectiveness in reducing community incidence in populations with a high concentration of TB in prisons and greater degrees of mixing between ex-prisoners and community members.",
            "Study limitations include our focus on a single Brazilian state and our retrospective use of administrative databases.",
            "Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prison environment, more so than the prison population itself, drives TB incidence, and targeted interventions within prisons could have a substantial effect on the broader TB epidemic."

            "Abstract",
            "Objectives",
            "To describe and analyze whether a relationship exists between gender equality and political responses to gender violence (GV) against women with physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) in the European Union (EU).",

            "We analyzed a subsample of 39,269 ever-partnered women aged 18 and older from the violence against women survey (2012) of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights.",
            "Outcome was last 12 months physical and/or sexual IPV.",
            "Multilevel Poisson regression models were used.",
            "Results",
            "Current prevalence of IPV was 4.2%.",
            "Having suffered abuse by an adult before age 15 was the strongest associated factor for increasing the probability of suffering (PR: 2.9).",
            "Living in countries with higher gender equality, with anti-GV legislation prior to 2005, in countries where the state involved multiple actors in GV response and in countries with family policies included in the Anglo-Saxon, Eastern European and Southern European typologies (reference: Nordic), diminishes the women likelihood of suffering IPV.",
            "Conclusions",
            "The response to IPV in the EU requires an integral approach that accounts for the efforts of multiple sectors as well as policies that reach greater levels of gender equality in the countries."

            "Four key principles outlined in the human rights in patient care framework highlight the importance of a finding that the prohibition of discrimination was violated in cases of forced sterilization: the need to highlight the vulnerability of marginalized populations to discrimination in health care settings; the importance of the rights of medical providers; the role of the state in addressing systemic human rights violations in health care settings; and the application of human rights to patient care.",

            "In this study, carried out with Romanian immigrants (N = 202), the aim was to test the extent to which discrimination in the workplace, health and legal contexts is linked to an important aspect of psychological well-being: self-acceptance.",
            "The results showed that immigrants had a relatively low level of perceived discrimination and good scores in self-acceptance, except for those who were unemployed.",
            "In addition, we examined the role of seeking social support in the relationship between perceived personal discrimination and self-acceptance.",
            "The structural equations analysis provided evidence that the postulated models fit the data well.",
            "Thus, it was confirmed that the higher the perceived personal discrimination, the lower the self-acceptance.",
            "The data also indicated that seeking social support mediates between perceived discrimination and psychological well-being.",
            "These findings demonstrate the protective effect of social support for the mental health of immigrants."

            "METHODS",
            "We undertook standardised population-based household surveys with a multistage representative sample of men aged 18-49 years in nine sites in Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Papua New Guinea between January, 2011, and December, 2012.",
            "We built multinomial regression models of factors associated with lifetime violence perpetration: physical IPV, sexual IPV, both physical and sexual IPV, multiple emotional or economic IPV versus none, and calculated population-attributable fractions.",

            "The prevalence of physical or sexual IPV perpetration, or both, varied by site, between 25\u00b74% (190/746; rural Indonesia) and 80\u00b70% (572/714; Bougainville, Papua New Guinea).",
            "When multiple emotional or economic abuse was included, the prevalence of IPV perpetration ranged from 39\u00b73% (409/1040; Sri Lanka) to 87\u00b73% (623/714; Bougainville, Papua New Guinea).",
            "Factors associated with IPV perpetration varied by country and type of violence.",
            "On the basis of population-attributable fractions, we show factors related to gender and relationship practices to be most important, followed by experiences of childhood trauma, alcohol misuse and depression, low education, poverty, and involvement in gangs and fights with weapons.",

            "Perpetration of IPV by men is highly prevalent in the general population in the sites studied.",

            "These findings of substantial savings are robust to the use of estimators with varying levels of control for selection, and to alternative data obtained from household self-reports.",
