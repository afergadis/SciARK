            "Objectives",
            "To quantitatively assess the relationships of childhood experiences of marriage, pregnancy, and sexual violence with underage sex trafficking.",
            "Methods",
            "Cross-sectional survey data from a population-based sample of 603 female sex workers from Tijuana and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, were collected in 2013 and 2014, and we analyzed the data to evaluate relationships between pregnancy, marriage, and sexual violence when younger than 16 years, and child sex trafficking.",
            "Results",
            "Adjusted odds of child sex trafficking among those who experienced pregnancy, marriage, and childhood sexual violence when younger than 16 years in combined models were 2.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.8, 4.3), 1.7 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.99, 2.8), and 1.7 (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01, 3.0), respectively, relative to others (n\u2009=\u2009603).",
            "For 89.8%, 78.0%, and 97.0% of those who had an experience of pregnancy (n\u2009=\u200969), marriage (n\u2009=\u200950), or sexual violence (n\u2009=\u200933) when younger than 16 years, respectively, the experience occurred before or the same year as sex trafficking.",
            "Conclusions",
            "These results provide empirical evidence of modifiable risk factors for child sex trafficking that could be integrated into the prevention efforts and protocols of health clinics and governmental agencies in Mexico currently working to reduce underage pregnancy, marriage, and sexual violence."

            "Objectives To explore how Somali women exposed to female genital mutilation experience and perceive antenatal and intrapartum care in England.",
            "We explored women's perceptions of deinfibulation, caesarean section and vaginal delivery; their experiences of care during pregnancy and labour; and factors that affect ability to access these services, in order to make recommendations about future practice.",
            "Design A descriptive, exploratory qualitative study using face-to-face semistructured interviews.",
            "Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and data were analysed using a thematic approach.",
            "An interpreter was used when required (n=3).",
            "Setting Participants recruited from 2 community centres in Birmingham, England.",
            "Participants Convenience and snowball sample of 10 Somali women resident in Birmingham, who had accessed antenatal care services in England within the past 5?years.",
            "Results 3 core themes were interpreted: (1) Experiences of female genital mutilation during life, pregnancy and labour: Female genital mutilation had a significant physical and psychological impact, influencing decisions to undergo deinfibulation or caesarean section.",
            "Women delayed deinfibulation until labour to avoid undergoing multiple operations if an episiotomy was anticipated.",
            "(2) Experience of care from midwives: Awareness of female genital mutilation from midwives led to open communication and stronger relationships with women, resulting in more positive experiences.",
            "(3) Adaptation to English life: Good language skills and social support networks enabled women to access these services, while unfavourable social factors (eg, inability to drive) impeded.",
            "Conclusions Female genital mutilation impacts Somali women's experiences of antenatal and intrapartum care.",
            "This study suggests that midwives should routinely ask Somali women about female genital mutilation to encourage open communication and facilitate more positive experiences.",
            "As antenatal deinfibulation is unpopular, we should consider developing strategies to promote deinfibulation to non-pregnant women, to align with current guidelines.",
            "Women with unfavourable social factors may require additional support to improve access to English antenatal care services."

            "The principle is to connect small energy generation stations and combined heat and power system (CHP) based on distributed energy technology and renewable energy into a network in the urban district.",
            "In this way, the cooling, heating and electricity could all back each other up.",
            "Each building of the community could collect the energy and then put that energy into the energy-internet to supply the heating and power to buildings.",
            "The power in the energy-internet could also be used for charging electric vehicles.",
            "So the energy use in the urban community would be basically self-sufficient.",
            "The energy generation stations in the energy-internet could be solar power, wind power, biomass cogeneration (including refuse power generation), household fuel cell, low-grade heat in rivers, lakes, urban sewage and soil.",
            "In this way, large-scale renewable energy and unused energy could be fully used and applied in a compact and dense community.",
            "If the energy-internet is suitable designed, the equipment capacity, energy consumption and CO2 emission of the community could be greatly reduced, energy efficiency could be optimized and improved and the heat island effect could also be alleviated.",
            "This article explores three major problems of the construction of energy internet and their solutions: namely, the location and layout of the energy station, the environmental economic dispatch model of the energy internet with power dispatching as an example, the optimal path design of hot water pipe network combined with graph theory and genetic algorithms."

            "The aim of this study was to identify factors that increased the likelihood of an event of domestic violence as reported by ever married Ghanaian women.",
            "Methods",
            "Data from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) was analysed using a multivariate logistic model and risk factors were obtained using the forward selection procedure.",
            "Results",
            "Of the 1524 ever married women in this study, 33.6 % had ever experienced domestic violence.",
            "The risk of ever experiencing domestic violence was 35 % for women who reside in urban areas.",
            "Risk of domestic violence was 41 % higher for women whose husbands ever experienced their father beating their mother.",
            "Women whose mother ever beat their father were three times more likely to experience domestic violence as compared to women whose mother did not beat their father.",
            "The risk of ever experiencing domestic violence was 48 % less likely for women whose husbands had higher than secondary education as compared to women whose husbands never had any formal education.",
            "Women whose husbands drink alcohol were 2.5 times more likely to experience domestic violence as compared to women whose husbands do not drink alcohol.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Place of residence, alcohol use by husband and family history of violence do increase a woman\u2019s risk of ever experiencing domestic violence.",
            "Higher than secondary education acted as a protective buffer against domestic violence.",
            "Domestic violence against women is still persistent and greater efforts should be channelled into curtailing it by using a multi-stakeholder approach and enforcing stricter punishments to perpetrators."

            "Abstract",
            "China is one of the most important marine fishery countries, yet little is known about its small-scale fisheries (SSFs).",
            "This paper uses Hainan Province of China as a case study to examine the present situation, predicaments, and future changes of the country's SSFs during a process of transition from extensive to green development.",
            "In doing so, we follow the social-ecological system (SES) framework to present Hainan's SSF-related settings, and study its resource systems, governance systems and actors through reviewing national and local policies, surveying and interviewing SSF stakeholders.",
            "Marine fisheries in Hainan is SSF-dominated, experienced dramatic increase in terms of yield and jobs since 1978, and became the main source of most fishermen's livelihood.",
            "Fish community structure and fishing targets have shifted from a mix of large-bodied demersals and pelagics to smaller-bodied pelagics with high growth rates and fecundity levels.",
            "This degradation puts stress on China's central and local governments to enhance the preservation of marine ecosystems.",
            "Effort controls failed to reduce fishing power due to subsidies, a series of measures were introduced in 2015 to correct these problems, including obligatory targets with accountability, subsidy reductions, buyback program, and further reductions of fishing vessels and allowable catch implemented in 2017.",
            "Hainan has explored different development directions for SSFs.",
            "First, providing policies and funds to reduce small fishing boats and construct larger vessels to support offshore and distant-water fisheries.",
            "Second, enhancing fishery value by integrating the development of fishery-related primary, secondary, and tertiary industries.",
            "Third, developing existing SSFs in a sustainable manner through standardizing SSF vessel types, delineating operating areas, developing fishing port economy, and building beautiful fishing villages.",
            "These practices illustrate that China's centralized government can likely command transformational changes in ecological and socio-economic outcomes according to policy objectives.",
            "Also, a broadened perspective that considers the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of SSFs as whole is also crucial.",
            "Moreover, the integration of fishery policies with other related socioeconomic policies, and the interdepartmental cooperation is needed to achieve policy consistency across local governments."

            "Methods: The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) was used to estimate reductions in all-cause child mortality due to changes in coverage of treatment for the integrated community case management (iCCM) illnesses - malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea - while accounting for other changes in maternal and child health interventions in each RAcE project area.",
            "Data from RAcE baseline and endline household surveys, Demographic and Health Surveys, and routine health service data were used in each LiST model.",
            "The models yielded estimated change in under-five mortality rates, and estimated number of lives saved per year by malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea treatment.",
            "We adjusted the results to estimate the number of lives saved by community health worker (CHW)-provided treatment.",
            "Results: The LiST model accounts for coverage changes in iCCM intervention coverage and other health trends in each project area to estimate mortality reduction and child lives saved.",
            "Under five mortality declined in all six RAcE sites, with an average decline of 10 percent.",
            "An estimated 6200 under-five lives were saved by malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea treatment in the DRC, Malawi, Niger, and Nigeria, of which approximately 4940 (75 percent) were saved by treatment provided by CHWs.",
            "This total excludes Mozambique, where there were no estimated under-five lives saved likely due to widespread stockouts of key medications.",
            "In all other project areas, lives saved by CHW-provided treatment contributed substantially to the estimated decline in under-five mortality.",
            "Conclusions: Our results suggest that iCCM is a strategy that can save lives and measurably decrease child mortality in settings where access to health facility services is low and adequate resources for iCCM implementation are provided for CHW services."
