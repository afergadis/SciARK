            "In 2015 the IMR in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) was 53.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is comparable to the United States in 1935 when IMR was 55.7 deaths per 1,000 live births.",
            "We contrast the role of public health institutions and interventions for IMR reduction in past versus present efforts to reduce infant mortality in LMICs to critically examine the current evidence base for reducing infant mortality and to propose ways in which lessons from history can inform efforts to address the current burden of infant mortality.",
            "Methods: We searched the peer-reviewed and gray literature on the causes and explanations behind the decline in infant mortality in the United States between 1850 and 1950 and in LMICs after 2000.",
            "We included historical analyses, empirical research, policy documents, and global strategies.",
            "For each key source, we assessed the factors considered by their authors to be salient in reducing infant mortality.",
            "Findings: Public health programs that played a central role in the decline in infant mortality in the United States in the early 1900s emphasized large structural interventions like filtering and chlorinating water supplies, building sanitation systems, developing the birth and death registration area, pasteurizing milk, and also educating mothers on infant care and hygiene.",
            "The creation of new institutions and policies for infant health additionally provided technical expertise, mobilized resources, and engaged women's groups and public health professionals.",
            "In contrast, contemporary literature and global policy documents on reducing infant mortality in LMICs have primarily focused on interventions at the individual, household, and health facility level, and on the widespread adoption of cheap, ostensibly accessible, and simple technologies, often at the cost of leaving the structural conditions that determine child survival largely untouched.",
            "Conclusions: Current discourses on infant mortality are not informed by lessons from history.",
            "Although structural interventions were central to the decline in infant mortality in the United States, current interventions in LMICs that receive the most global endorsement do not address these structural determinants of infant mortality.",
            "Using a historical lens to examine the continued problem of infant mortality in LMICs suggests that structural interventions, especially regarding sanitation and civil registration, should again become core to a public health approach to addressing infant mortality.",

            "Abstract",
            "This article aims to do two things.",
            "First, it argues that moralization of health occurs not only at the practical level of individual healthcare choices and health states, but also at the conceptual level of health itself.",
            "This is most evident in cases where the concept of health is presumed to possess the property of \"overridingness\" when compared to competing values and norms, that is, when it is treated as taking precedence over other values and norms it may come into conflict with.",
            "Second, the article makes a case for being critically skeptical of specific deployments of the concept of health when it has been moralized in this way.",
            "In such cases, what typically results is that some other personal value/norm, or set of values/norms, held by the individual is treated as intrinsically at odds with the concept of health, which is presumed, uncritically, to be superior, often because it is taken to be free-standing and self-justifying.",
            "Yet, a growing body of evidence-based research suggests that the role played by dimensions of personal meaningfulness in the quality of individuals' overall health is quite underappreciated.",
            "It is useful to think of these dimensions of personal meaning and significance as representing the individual's values.",
            "Thus, taking these data more seriously ought to lead to a reevaluation of the moralization of health at the conceptual level.",
            "In the first place, it is not obvious that if the concept of health runs afoul of other values/norms held by an individual, the latter should automatically yield.",
            "In the second place, they suggest that other values/norms held by an individual are not necessarily intrinsically opposed to the concept of health, but in fact may go a good distance in support of it.",

            "Abstract:",
            "Over the past decades, commodities and their derivative products have gone through boom and bust cycles and periods of high and low volatility, but have also shown a continued trend in increased trading volumes as well as emerging new markets and products.",
            "The focus of this special issue is to draw together connected papers from the field of Quantitative Finance that are dedicated to the increasingly important issue of commodities.",
            "These papers make important contributions in terms of new methodology, techniques, commodity classes, econometrics and risk management tools.",
            "The first paper by Ly\u00f3csa and Moln\u00e1r applies heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models to high-frequency data to predict the one-day forward volatilities of two strategically linked commodities, gold and silver.",
            "They provide evidence that it is difficult to beat benchmark models using univariate models and that a much better strategy is to average the forecasts from many models.",
            "In the second paper, Ewald, Nawar, Ouyang and Siu use the popular Schwartz 97 two-factor approach to study future contracts written on fresh farmed salmon.",
            "These futures have been actively traded at the Fish Pool Market in Norway since 2006.",
            "They connect this approach with the classical literature on fish-farming and aquaculture using first principles, starting by modelling the aggregate salmon farming production process and modelling the demand using a Cobb\u2013Douglas utility function for a representative consumer.",
            "G\u00f6nc\u00fc and Akyildirim introduce an optimal pairs trading model and verify its performance in the commodity futures markets in the third paper.",
            "They provide empirical evidence from commodity futures to indicate the existence of significant mean-reversion together with high peak and fat tails for the distribution of spread residuals.",
            "In consequence, they use an Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process with the noise term driven by a Levy process with generalized hyperbolic distributed marginals.",
            "Empirical examples and backtesting results obtained from commodity futures data show strong support for the profitability of the model even in the presence of transaction costs.",
            "Kyriakou, Pouliasis and Papapostolou focus in the fourth paper on Asian options.",
            "Such options are favoured by many risk managers, being effective and cost-saving hedging instruments due to the reduced variance of the underlying and reduced exposure to manipulative trading.",
            "Their paper has both empirical and theoretical contributions: they conduct an empirical analysis of crude oil price dynamics and develop an accurate pricing set-up for arithmetic Asian options with discrete and continuous monitoring, featuring stochastic volatility and discontinuous underlying asset price movements.",
            "They find that price jumps and stochastic volatility are necessary to fit options.",
            "In the fifth paper, Karathanasopoulos, Dunis and Khalil expand on earlier work carried that modelled the Crack Spread from 01/01/1995 to 01/01/2005.",
            "Their paper which is a combined PSO (Particle Swarm Optimizer) and a RBF (Radial Basis Function) Neural Network (NN), however, provides a more sophisticated approach to non-linear modelling of the \u2018Crack\u2019.",
            "Kellard, Tsvetanov and Coakley find that news related to future GDP growth is a significant factor that is priced in the cross-section of commodity futures sorted by percentage net basis.",
            "Their results are presented in the sixth paper.",
            "They show that commodity futures with high inventory levels provide a hedge against risk associated with future GDP growth so that investors are willing to accept lower returns.",
            "By contrast, those commodity futures with low inventory levels are inversely related to the GDP-related factors so that investors require a higher return.",
            "These results suggest that commodity futures excess returns are a compensation for risk.",
            "In paper seven, Stasinakis, Sermpinis, Psaradelis and Verousis study a Krill Herd \u2013 Support Vector Regression (KH-vSVR) model.",
            "The Krill Herd (KH) algorithm is a novel metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by the behaviour of krill herds.",
            "The KH optimizes the SVR parameters by balancing the search between local and global optima.",
            "The proposed model is applied to the task of forecasting and trading three commodity Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on a daily basis over the period 2012\u20132014.",
            "It is shown that the KH-vSVR outperforms its counterparts in terms of statistical accuracy and trading efficiency, while the leverage strategy is found to be successful.",

            "Empirical results suggest strong evidence that the subprime crisis has lowered the level/trend and increased the volatility of crude oil prices."

            "The oral health of Inuit children in Canada has been identified as a public health crisis.",
            "Although efforts are being made to identify and address ways to deal with this crisis, current policy and program approaches are largely entrenched within the prevailing paradigm of dental science to the exclusion of Indigenous people's understandings of health.",

            "Through 18 focus groups with youth (n = 86), caregivers (n = 22), and interviews with key informant (n = 13), this study begins to elucidate southern Inuit understandings of oral health.",
            "Theorized using Two-Eyed Seeing, an Indigenous approach to balancing both Indigenous and non-Indigenous understandings of the world, the findings reported here reveal 3 themes, each of which is crosscut by historical and contemporary dimensions: 1) (w)holistic conceptualizations of health are essential to good oral health, 2) achieving optimal oral health is prohibitive for Inuit communities, and 3) community-engaged oral health service delivery is needed.",
            "Our recommendations have implications for improved oral public health service delivery for Inuit communities, in that the inclusion of Inuit perspectives on oral health should form an instrumental element of oral public health service delivery.",
            "Knowledge Transfer Statement: The results of this study may be used by clinicians and oral health educators to inform approaches to oral health service delivery within the context of Indigenous communities.",
            "It may also be used by policymakers to recognize how historical and contemporary issues of colonization relate to the formation of oral health-related policies.",

            "In contrast to the increasing research on elder abuse and neglect, sexual violence in older adults remains a largely under-researched area.",
            "In a meta-analysis of elder abuse prevalence in community settings, only 16 of 52 included studies addressed sexual violence.",
            "Moreover, reported prevalences of sexual violence in older adults were likely to be underestimated because of several methodological problems.",
            "First, most studies only included questions about rape, which is much less common than for example sexual harassment or sexual abuse without penetration.",
            "Second, in the majority of studies older adults were interviewed via telephone, which could lead to underreporting caused by safety issues, especially when victim and assailant live together.",
            "Third, all studies exclude cognitive impaired older adults who are known to be vulnerable to different types of abuse.",
            "And finally, all studies focus on assailants known to the victim, ignoring the fact that older adults can also be sexually offended by strangers.",
            "In summary, sexual violence in older adults is still too often conflated with other types of violence in the broader context of elder abuse and neglect.",

            "Even the leading organisations providing guidance on care, including WHO, ignore the complexity of sexual violence in older adults by not including \u201cdisrespect of (sexual) intimacy\u201d and \u201csexual neglect\u201d into their definition of elder abuse and neglect.",
            "This exclusion might lead to inadequate care of older adult victims of sexual violence.",
